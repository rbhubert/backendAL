" we wrote back and forth for over a year , " she said . " i trusted him . " she said gaddy told her about all the prison courses he had taken aimed at rehabilitation . she thought he was no longer the angry young man who had killed someone . " i truly believe people can change , " she said . in hindsight , she admitted she chose to ignore or explain away the red flags that might have stopped her from leaving her life in edmonton for what she thought would be a romantic new adventure . " he promised me the world , " said bohemier , who has a university degree in business management and accounting . " he would take care of me . he loved me . i was everything to him . and i believed him . " last september , the mother of five , whose children are mostly grown , quit her job in edmonton as a gravel truck driver and drove down to the united states on a six - month visitor visa . when gaddy was released on parole on sept . 2 , 2019 , she was at the avery - mitchell correctional institution in spruce pine , n . c . , to pick him up . " i thought he had changed , " said bohemier , who admitted she sometimes likes to take chances . the first attack happened in october , she said , when he put his hands around her neck . she went to the hospital because she had neck pain , blurry vision , a headache and was unable to hear out of one ear . but she didn ' t tell the doctor the truth about her injuries . in a medical record provided to cbc news , a doctor wrote of bohemier : " reports that last night she was in a bar in downtown charlotte when she was assaulted when she went to the bathroom . " the doctor said bohemier told him a woman had tried to strangle her and she was punched in the head and had her head slammed against a wall . she was given pain medication and written advice about domestic violence . two weeks later , on nov . 2 , 2019 , gaddy beat her unconscious with a blow to the head while they were in a car , she said .

" and he said no , we can ' t take you to the hospital , " bohemier recalled . " i ' ve got to take you home and clean up the blood because i ' ll be arrested if they see you like this . " police went to their house to check on her welfare . gaddy was nearby , listening . " i was terrified , " she said . " i lied actually and said i got jumped at the gas station . i didn ' t tell them it was him . " bohemier felt like it was easier to lie to the police than to risk gaddy ' s wrath . " the thing that went in my mind was if i tell them , he ' s going to kill me eventually . so i hid it . " bohemier remembered what gaddy had told her during an argument she secretly recorded , after she suggested she was going to call 911 . she provided the recording to cbc news . " don ' t call 911 , because i ' ll kill you and i ' ll kill my - goddamn - self , " gaddy yelled on the tape . " we ' ll look just like somebody on abc news . " ' you know i ' d never hurt you for real ' the abuse continued . bohemier said she packed her bags and tried to leave many times . one time , she said , gaddy tried to strangle her . with her suitcase open on the floor , she again secretly recorded their argument by placing her phone in her bra . kay bohemier shows injuries she suffered in the november 2019 assault .

" you know i ' d never hurt you for real , " he said . " i know in my mind not to hurt somebody i love . i ain ' t that stupid . " he apologized and told her he loved her . " i love you , too , " she responded . an expert on domestic violence said studies have shown a victim can leave her partner between seven and 20 times before fleeing for good .

analysis conducted by researchers at washington university in st . louis and the university of texas at arlington . however , researchers found that success rate gets complicated once you look at interviews with the survivors of domestic abuse . their lived reports indicate “ no significant effect ” on violent behaviour . as the researchers put it : “ it is possible that ( batterer intervention program ) s may reduce criminalized behaviour but not abusive behaviour . ” tweet thisalexandra lysova is a criminology professor at simon fraser university who studies intimate partner violence . “ there is nearly zero effectiveness of these programs , ” she says . some of the criticism centres on the programs ’ one -

__label__no_relevant revolutionary toronto shelter will help heal abused men , their families new expositor series examines the hidden crisis of male - victim family violenceeditor ’ s note : the male victim experience of domestic violence and abuse is a topic that warrants closer examination to better understand this under - reported and stigmatized social issue . the expositor will be exploring various facets of this problem in future editions , beginning with an overview of the plans for the forthcoming ccmf shelter in toronto . toronto – the first - ever family shelter for abused fathers and children is edging closer to completion following an $80 , 000 gift from digital technology holding company grindstone capital to the canadian centre for men and families ( ccmf ) , aiming to create a first - of - its - kind facility to support an aspect of domestic violence that is often overlooked by the general population . “ imagine you and your child live each day in fear of violence , but no one believes you , ” said canadian centre for men and families executive director justin trottier . “ that is the situation for thousands of fathers every year . ” when thinking of the term domestic abuse , the first mental imagery that likely comes to mind is a raging man taking out his aggressions on a ( usually female ) partner or young children . while those situations certainly happen , they create a skewed perspective that fails to account for situations when men and their children are the victims of an abusive partner . statistics begin to reveal the truth behind domestic abuse and the lack of supports that exist for men . in canada , 75 percent of all people who die by suicide are men . police studies show that a majority of family violence victims are women , but when looking at the data for a broader population , the proportions move to nearly equal . why would those rates differ ? advocates cite two main reasons . first , male victimization within a family violence context is still heavily stigmatized , with men being more likely to be told to not speak out about their issues or “ be a man , ” which dismisses the existence of the problem and can make victims less likely to involve law enforcement for issues of this nature . secondly , police protocol for handling domestic violence situations tends to work through a gender lens that inherently gives more protection to women present in a situation . these policies come from a well - meaning place ; statistics show that although men and women are victims of domestic abuse nearly equally , when looking at individuals who experience physical harm , those numbers are highly skewed toward female victims . domestic homicide rates , which involves death at the hands of an intimate partner , show 75 percent being women and 25 percent being men . but not all incidents involve physical harm , nor are domestic disputes one - sided . family violence is most often “ bilateral , ” meaning both sides of a dispute are aggressive and violent . a british columbia study of police calls for partner violence incidents in 1993 revealed that officers declined to recommend charges against women 66 percent of the time , whereas they would refuse to recommend charges against men only 20 percent of the time . in the same province over a five - year average , when men were accused of abusing their partner , 70 . 4 percent were charged . however , when women were accused of being abusers , only 23 . 6 percent were charged . “ all of this tends to support the inference that police exercise their discretion in such a way as to treat female perpetrators more leniently than male perpetrators in general , ” wrote author grant a . brown in a 2004 study within the peer - reviewed journal sexuality and culture . the effects of violence on victims are long - lasting and are important to address . researchers have found that psychological impacts tend to be similar , regardless of a victim ’ s gender . a study of male victims who contacted the us national domestic abuse helpline found 58 percent had post - traumatic stress disorder , 20 percent had experienced extreme violence and more than three - quarters sustained injuries ( at an average rate of 11 per person ) . the statistics pointing toward a need for facilities for men and families , similar to those that exist for women and families , are compelling and lead to questions of why these centres have not existed to date . “ when we leave out victims because of their gender or sexual orientation—because abuse is also prevalent in same - sex relationships—they feel ignored , it leaves people vulnerable and alone to suffer in silence . regardless of one ’ s sexual orientation or gender they should have the same amount of support and also be believed when they talk to their friends and family , ” said mr . trottier . some shelters do exist which are gender agnostic and will welcome all victims of family violence . an example on manitoulin island is wiikwemkoong ’ s recently opened nookomisnaang shelter , although it can only accommodate a limited capacity of clients like all shelters . the only male - focused shelter currently in existence in canada is men ’ s resource centre in winnipeg , which welcomes victims from across manitoba to its emergency shelter and also runs healing programs and services . the national 2017 / 2018 survey of residential facilities for victims of abuse found that of 552 then - operating shelters across canada , 15 shelters—just under three percent—could accommodate either men or women , as well as their children . there was not a single shelter specifically serving men , or men and their children . the men ’ s resource centre was likely included within the 15 , as it is run as a sub - program of a women ’ s shelter . a 2020 edition of the above survey will be taking place between april and august of this year , which will provide more up - to - date figures on the status of the disparity in the country .

" this teenager has the right to emancipate herself , and aspire to more legitimate personal achievements such as marrying someone she loves , wanting to practise a profession and deciding herself what she wears and who she sees , " youth court judge bruno langelier said in his decision . " she has the right to freedom of conscience and religion , to be free to decide her future and not to be subjected to a fiancé who controls everything and who obliges her to wear the hijab . she wants to be free , and free from the dictates of the men around her , " langelier continued . youth protection laws forbid cbc news from naming the girl or any details that might identify her . marriage ' contract ' the girl and her family came to canada in 2016 as refugee claimants . a copy of a marriage contract dated may 2018 between the girl ' s family and her fiancé ' s family was entered into evidence in court . the girl was 15 years old at the time and the fiancé was in his 20s . the contract shows the fiancé ' s family agreed to pay a dowry of $3 , 000 to the girl ' s family , and that the marriage ceremony would take place in may 2019 . the contract was signed by the girl ' s father , the fiancé , some witnesses and an imam , but not by the girl herself . neighbours protect girllast april , just weeks before the marriage was to take place , the girl ran to a neighbour ' s house , begging for help . according to the court decision , the girl ' s mother , brother and her fiancé showed up at the neighbour ' s house demanding she be turned over . soon other members of the community showed up to support the girl ' s family and things degenerated .

" here ( in canada ) all the girls from my country have changed . families are afraid . our daughters come here , they talk back to their mothers , they want to leave . all my friends are afraid that their daughters will leave the house , " the father testified . in his testimony , the fiancé admitted to controlling some elements of the girl ' s life , saying that she now had a responsibility to him and to their household . " everything must be within certain limits . it is forbidden that she speaks with a man , or that she speaks with a stranger or even greets one with her hand , " he testified . judge believes girl " the court believes the teenager about the fears she feels . certainly she is under pressure and control to marry the fiancé , " langelier said in his decision . he noted that the girl was so afraid of her family and fiancé that she didn ' t want to be present at the hearing . he also noted that the marriage contract entered into evidence appeared to be illegal , and that the marriage was never properly registered with the government . he said the imam who signed the contract should have known the marriage was illegal . " the planned marriage certainly was in line with the customs of the family ' s home country . however , these customs cannot prevail in the province of quebec . there is only one rule of law , and it applies to all residents of the province , " langelier said . " the court acknowledges the existence of overwhelming evidence that the safety and development of the adolescent girl is compromised as a result of psychological abuse , " he continued . langelier ordered that the girl be placed in custody of a foster family until she ' s 18 . the ruling stipulated that her new address must remain confidential , and that she wasn ' t obliged to have contact with her parents unless she wished to . youth protection officials refused to comment on the case , citing confidentiality .

" this pandemic sheds light on inequalities we have already , " says dr . astrid guttmann , chief science officer at ices and a physician at sickkids hospital . compared with ontarians not tested for covid - 19 , those tested — and those confirmed positive — were more likely to live in neighbourhoods with greater residential instability , material deprivation and dependency , and lower income status , the research found . those confirmed positive also were more likely to live in communities with a relatively greater concentration of immigrants and visible minorities . the findings are still preliminary , but so far the results aren ' t surprising , guttmann adds . that ' s because researchers have long known poverty and marginalization put people at a greater risk of poor health , which can be tied to any combination of factors from high stress levels , to food insecurity , to crowded — or nonexistent — housing . " what covid has done is just made this unignorable , " says dr . andrew boozary , an assistant professor at the university of toronto ' s dalla lana school of public health . " but we ' ve ignored it and been willfully blind to these outcomes for decades . " waiting for test results , pregnant and aloneit ' s now may , and diamond is sitting in the lobby of a downtown hotel , holding her weeks - old baby girl . the newborn is wrapped up in a white blanket with little pink polka dots with her face covered by a black - and - white striped towel . her mother speaks slowly , her quiet voice muffled by her blue surgical mask . " i ' m in canada by myself . i don ' t have family here , " she says . diamond moved here from ethiopia five years ago . earlier this year , she first entered a toronto women ' s shelter after fleeing domestic abuse , and while she ' s not sure if that ' s where she caught the disease during the third trimester of her pregnancy , it ' s a possibility . " in the shelter , i lived in one room with three people , " she explains . " sharing the washroom — everything . " toronto midwife jenna bly demonstrates the level of personal protective equipment she now wears while helping vulnerable covid - positive clients . ( evan mitsui / cbc ) that ' s where she first met bly , who has spent the last year - and - a - half working with precariously - housed clients as the creator and co - lead for south riverdale community health centre ' s match midwives program , a role she shares with fellow co - lead shezeen suleman . after diamond tested positive for covid - 19 , the hours leading up to her delivery in mid - april were full of fear and uncertainty for both women . for bly , who is married with three little girls of her own , it marked her first time helping deliver a baby for a covid - positive mother . while getting ready to head to the hospital , she wondered if she was putting her own family at risk . " there ' s this deadly virus ravaging the world , and i had to be in the room with it , " bly says . " then i got in the room , with this person that i knew , and i was just providing care . " thankfully , after delivering a healthy baby , her client didn ' t need to use the end - of - life directives in her living will — her symptoms never worsened beyond a cough . but who was going to care for her now , this new mother with a contagious disease ? at the urging of bly and the midwife team , diamond and her newborn were later admitted to toronto ' s so - called " covid hotel . " there , on a site near an industrial area of the city — the exact location is being kept secret from the general public — residents experiencing both homelessness and covid - 19 are able to recover under the city ' s watch . ' the only lasting solution is housing ' the 200 - bed recovery facility opened in april in partnership with the university health network , inner city health associates and other community health providers , and provides medical support and meals to clients and even toys , which are cleaned in between uses , for their children . so far , more than 210 people like diamond have come and gone , with close to 80 clients currently staying at the site . mary - anne bédard , general manager of toronto ' s shelter , support and housing administration , says a second site opened on may 16 in a downtown location , which is providing a space for people awaiting test results and close contacts of confirmed or suspected cases . bédard says these sites are opening at " record speed . " others say the city lagged behind in its efforts , leaving too many homeless residents stuck in the close quarters of toronto ' s jam - packed shelter system as the city ' s case count kept rising . " it certainly was a catalyst for spread , " says rafi aaron , a spokesperson for the toronto - based interfaith coalition to fight homelessness . " because , at the best of times , the conditions people were in were breeding grounds for covid - 19 . " crowded shelters , like other congregate settings , have proved to be a flash point for transmission . as of may 20 , toronto has experienced 352 covid - 19 cases tied to outbreaks in the shelter system . dr . andrew boozary , an assistant professor at university of toronto ' s dalla lana school of public heath , was co - lead on the project .

" we finally understand the centrality of housing to well - being — to health care — because of covid . " boozary , the assistant professor at u of t , calls housing " the only lasting solution . " with covid - 19 further exposing the health disparities and vulnerabilities of marginalized residents , he says all levels of government need to build strategies to house all canadians . and sooner , not later , amid growing fears the cases among the country ' s poor and homeless could keep rising , with a ripple effect long after the pandemic ends . " being able to provide people with decent comfortable housing has health - care benefits , cost benefits , economic benefits , " boozary says . " and most importantly , there ' s human dignity . " slipping through the cracksfor diamond , the covid - 19 crisis is just another hurdle she didn ' t need . after recovering from her illness at the " covid hotel , " she was sent to her current living quarters in another city - operated hotel room , kilometres away , with her baby . she ' s not sure where she ' ll go next . bly , who is still checking on diamond with the match midwives team , is trying to connect her to housing providers , hoping to find her a permanent roof over her head . but with years - long wait lists for social housing , the future looks bleak . bly worries her client , and others like her , will simply slip through the cracks . diamond speaks to cbc news reporter lauren pelley in the lobby of a downtown toronto hotel while cradling her infant daughter .

__label__relevant migrant farm workers vulnerable to sexual violence : u of t expert after teresa filed a report against her farm employer for sexual assault , he asked her how much money it would take for her to retract her statement . in the spring of 2014 , teresa ( not her real name ) was attacked by her boss on his farm in british columbia . on the day the assault occurred , the boss sent teresa ’ s male co - workers to another farm for the day , leaving her and another female farm worker behind . while they were trellising grape vines , the women ran out of twine . teresa ’ s boss told her to come and get more twine inside a shed , where she says he forced his mouth onto hers and began grabbing her inappropriately . she managed to shake off his grip and run back to her co - worker in the vineyard for support . it was her word against his , and the crown decided there wasn ’ t enough evidence to proceed with the charges . in canada , 46 per cent of women survivors don ’ t even report sexual assault because they think there is insufficient proof . teresa is a single mom from baja california , mexico . since 2012 , she has been supporting her parents and two daughters by spending up to eight months each year on canadian farms through the seasonal agricultural worker program ( sawp ) . teresa was concerned that speaking up about the sexual assault might hurt her and her female co - worker ’ s future job chances . she says mexico ’ s secretariat of labour and social welfare verbally warns sawp workers each season before they leave mexico : “ ‘you ’ re coming to canada to work , not to cause problems . ’ if you complain about something , they kick you out of the program . ” elise hjalmarson ( author provided ) after the assault , teresa was transferred to a small vegetable farm , where her new employer provided accommodations in a rodent - infested trailer without a functional lock . teresa ’ s attacker lived in the adjacent village in british columbia ’ s southern interior . she suffered from recurrent nightmares . “ i was afraid . i thought he was going to show up or that he was going to do something to me . ” our connections with migrant women survivors of sexual assault are based on field research we have conducted since 2013 with migrant farm workers in canada . we are also volunteer members of grassroots advocacy organizations in british columbia and ontario that provide front - line support for farm workers . canada ’ s sawp is the main agricultural stream of the temporary foreign worker program . it began in 1966 in response to lobbying from farmers and that year in ontario , 264 jamaican workers were hired . since then , the program has expanded to all canadian provinces , bringing workers from mexico and 11 caribbean countries . in 2017 , approximately 40 , 000 workers came to canada as a part of the sawp – around 7 , 500 to british columbia . of those , less than four per cent were women . the structure of the sawp heightens the power imbalance between workers and employers , amplifying women ’ s vulnerability to sexual assault . work permits are tied to a specific employer , so getting fired typically means getting deported . workers in abusive workplaces often have difficulty transferring to a new boss . to be rehired the following season , a farm worker must receive a positive evaluation from their employer . power imbalancesthe sawp requirements effectively deter worker complaints about labour practices , housing conditions , workplace injuries or violence . the sawp contains no pathway to citizenship , even for men and women who have worked in canada for decades . workers and critics of the program argue that permanently categorizing migrants as “ non - citizens ” means they have fewer rights and protections than canadian workers . the sawp has been a boon for growers , who have access to a seemingly unending pool of workers whose urgent need for income makes them unlikely to dissent . alongside the temporary foreign worker program , a smaller number of migrants arrive in canada on tourist visas and work under the table during the harvest . luz ( not her real name ) , a 30 - year - old actor from sonora , mexico , was one such tourist . in the summer of 2015 , luz arrived in british columbia hoping to work for a few months to save some money to pay off her student loans . while employed on a cherry orchard in the similkameen valley , her boss sexually assaulted her . on the day she was attacked , her boss sent her co - workers to other parts of the farm and then grabbed her while she was walking through an empty storehouse . he forcibly groped her and began kissing her neck . luz demanded he stop and tried pushing him away , but he was significantly bigger than her . her mind was racing , “ i ’ m all alone , no one ’ s around , i could run , i could yell . but if i yell , who ’ s going to hear me ? a thousand things came into my head , and i didn ’ t know what to do . ” after much deliberation , luz decided not to go report the groping to the canadian police as she feared deportation . while sexual assault in general is the most underreported violent crime in canada , a precarious citizenship status presents an additional barrier to reporting for migrant women ( both undocumented and government - authorized ) . both teresa and luz said a fear of deportation was a major factor in deciding whether to report their assaults . both women knew of other workers who had been sent home for complaining to authorities about living conditions , workplace injuries , bullying and harassment . solidarity with #metoo across north americadespite immense injustices for migrant women , there are slow signs of change . in 2015 , the human rights tribunal of ontario awarded more than $200 , 000 to two sisters from mexico hired under the temporary foreign worker program . the tribunal found that presteve foods , a fish - packing plant in ontario , had created a “ sexually poisoned work environment . ” thirty - nine migrant women from thailand and mexico participated as complainants . the woman who received the highest damages , known as o . p . t . , described how the former plant owner forced her to perform sexual acts , threatening deportation if she didn ’ t comply . in her statement , o . p . t . highlighted how canada ’ s migrant worker program continues to create the conditions for abuse : “ under the temporary foreign worker program , the boss has all the power – over your money , house , status , everything …that happened to me eight years ago , and the system is still the same . ” amid the pressure for systemic change from movements like #metoo and times up , farm worker women are pointing to the specific ways race , class and gender can amplify women ’ s risk of workplace sexual abuse . in november , the alianza nacional de campesinas , representing more than 700 , 000 women farm workers in the united states , released a letter in solidarity with hollywood actors who had survived sexual assault , highlighting the gender inequity that pervades both industries . the coalition of immokalee workers ( ciw ) , a farm worker - led organization , has been calling on the wendy ’ s fast - food chain to sign onto an independent workplace monitoring program that would help prevent sexual violence in fields where the restaurant ’ s tomatoes are produced . after a five - day freedom fast , ciw farm worker women marched in new york city . some were accompanied by their daughters . solutions for a better futuredespite all the pain she has experienced in canada , teresa says thinking about her own daughters gives her the strength to keep going . as part of a cultural shift toward gender equity , we need to revamp canada ’ s laws , institutions and policies to better protect all women , including farm workers . the b . c . government has promised to establish a registry that could help prevent migrant workers from being charged illegal recruitment fees , which is a positive starting point . as supported by u . s . research on sexual assault services , provinces could also set up anonymous , toll - free and multilingual crisis hotlines for workers , including those who are undocumented . to address the multiple barriers faced by migrant farm worker women to health care , researchers have recommended enrolling workers in provincial health - care plans instead of private insurance schemes . free legal services and english - language classes could also strengthen women ’ s ability to assert their rights . workers should have the right to a fair appeal process before deportation . ultimately , the canadian government should eliminate tied work permits and provide migrant workers with full immigration status , two steps that would immediately lessen the disproportionate power of the employer . such changes would also go a long way toward ensuring that those who do the vital work of growing the food we eat receive the respect , freedom and dignity they deserve . anelyse weiler is a phd candidate in sociology and pierre elliott trudeau foundation scholar at the university of toronto . this article was originally published on the conversation . read the original article .

" the procedure can involve removing the clitoris , labia minora or both . in some cases , the labia minora or labia majora are cut , repositioned and sometimes stitched to seal the area . according to the world health organization , fgm can cause severe bleeding , problems urinating , cysts , infections , complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths . " if we don ' t talk about it , there will be all the silence and people can do all sorts of things when they ' re silent , " abdikadir said .

__label__relevant wiff documentary shines spotlight on female genital mutilation ask giselle portenier why she chose to travel to tanzania for her latest documentary , and she ' ll say that tanzania actually chose her . according to the self - described human rights filmmaker , whose latest project in the name of your daughter is set to screen at this year ' s windsor international film festival ( wiff ) , it was actually a google alert about female genital mutilation ( fgm ) that led portenier to her next project . " i was looking for a story that might be accessible to my audience , that people could engage with , " said portenier . " i had [set] a google alert about female genital mutilation for about five years , and one day , this story popped up about a safehouse that saves girls from their own parents so that they won ' t be mutilated . " as a documentarian , portenier has spent much of her career making films about the human rights of women and children around the world . " i ' ve made films about honour killings in pakistan and child slavery in africa , " she said . " female genital mutilation is something that had always eluded me , but i always felt was a very important topic . " listen to gisele portenier discuss her film on windsor morning : female genital mutilation is the subject of a documentary screening at the windsor international film festival . if you think it ' s something that only affects women in far - flung countries , you ' re be mistaken . tony speaks with director giselle portenier about why this film , and this difficult subject , is something all canadians should pay attention to . 8 : 54when portenier came across the safehouse in tanzania — run by rhobi samwelly , who is heavily featured in portenier ' s latest film — she knew she had a responsibility to tell the story of the women and girls who rely on the organization for security . " my film is really about the voices of the girls , the voices of the children who are running away to save themsleves from female genital mutilation and the child marriage that follows thereafter , " portenier said . still , while the film touches on a topic that has affected hundreds of millions of girls around the world — including almost 100 , 000 girls and women in canada — portenier said she hopes audiences leave the documentary inspired . wiff executive director vincent georgie says the festival doesn ' t shy away from films that portray complicated subject matter . ( katerina georgieva / cbc ) " [i hope] audiences walk away from it inspired by the children , because some of them are only eight - years - old , " she said . " imagine an eight - year - old risking her life and her family by running away from home , just so she won ' t have to go through the mutilation that she ' s heard about perhaps at school and knows is a risk to her life and her future . " vincent georgie , executive director and chief programmer of wiff , said the festival doesn ' t shy away from films that cover sensitive topics , adding that in the name of your daughter is a " very important film to show at the festival , and one that we believe in very much . " " one of the luxuries of running a large film festival like ours , is you ' re able to bring in all sorts of different films for different audiences and different points of view , " he said . " and we ' ve never shied away from films that are challenging our films that are different or films that provoke or make you think . " ' i hope it ' s educational , ' says survivorfrancis cole , a survivor of female genital mutilation , who advocates for women and girls around the world by sharing her own story , said she ' s portenier ' s film educates audiences , rather than presenting an inaccurate view of the issue . " i hope that this has a message of educating people about the practice , " she said . " i just hope that they ' ll be made more aware if they ' re not already aware about what fgm is . " cole said she also hopes portneir ' s film acknowledges that fgm isn ' t just a practice maintained by any one particular religious group . francis cole is a female genital mutilation survivor who advocates against the practice . ( amy dodge / cbc ) " when people hear about fgm , they automatically think it ' s a muslim thing , " said cole , who has yet to see in the name of your daughter . " i was raised catholic and i wasn ' t spared . " cole added that she hopes audiences understand that fgm is a " global issue . " " it ' s a human rights violation , " she said . " it ' s torture and it has lifelong consequence and it ' s happening all around us . it ' s no longer happening in some remote village in a country in africa . " speaking about the subject , portenier acknowledged that an important thing to note is that fgm " doesn ' t have anything to do with religion . " " [in] the safehouse , for instance , there are children from muslim communities , children from christian communties and also from animist traditions , " she said . fgm is about ' sexual control of girls , ' says filmmakerwhile many might believe female genital mutilation is a cultural practice , portenier said the truth is far less complicated . " the common denominator everywhere is sexual control of girls , " she said . " it ' s thought that if you put a girl through female genital mutilation , she won ' t be having sex before marriage , and then she won ' t be having affairs — be unfaithful — during marriage . " at the same time , portenier wants her audience to understand that topics like female genital mutilation don ' t just take place in so - called " other " parts of the world . " there are 200 million survivors and every 11 seconds somewhere in the world , a girl is going through fgm and that ' s a lot of children , " she said . " it ' s also a canadian issue … because we have upwards of 100 , 000 survivors in canada and these women are not getting the support that they need . " " and we have girls at risk . government documents show that girls are being taken in the summer months back to their home country to be cut . " windsor refugee settlement agency connects fgm survivors with access to caremike morency , executive director of windsor ' s matthew house refugee welcome centre , echoed portenier ' s comments about fgm survivors in canada . according to morency , his agency has seen an increase in women fleeing to canada to escape fgm or who have already experienced the issue . " we ' re certainly seen an increase in the number of people fleeing to canada , and while that ' s not the exclusive reason for their refugee claim , it is part of their story , " he said . matthew house executive director mike morency says access to trauma counselling is essential for survivors of female genital mutilation . ( chris ensing / cbc ) as for how matthew house provides support to survivors , morency said an important part of the work he does is " connecting them with counsellors , trauma experts to deal with the experiences that they have had prior to coming to canada . " " depending on the depth of their trauma , we would want to try to make sure that they get connected with a counselor that has trauma treatment experience and help them walk through that process , " morency said .

the ongoing trend towards more education for girls and women and easier access to contraception around the world is going to accelerate the decline in fertility rates and slow population growth . by the year 2064 , the study ’ s authors expect the world ’ s population will peak at 9 . 73 billion . then , it will slide back down to 8 . 79 billion in a little more than three decades . by the year 2100 , it ’ s expected the planet will have seen a population drop of 940 million , almost twice as many people as currently live in all of north america , including the united states , canada and mexico , from its peak population figure . read morerecord canada population growth dominated by immigrationimmigration drives nova scotia population to all - time highannual immigration of 300 , 000 leads to largest canadian population boost since 1957canada ’ s own population is expected to mushroom to almost 44 . 1 million people with a fertility rate of 1 . 58 children per woman by the year 2100 but , under an alternative scenario put forth by the study , could be even lower than today ’ s current population of about 37 . 6 million people . under that sustainable development goal model , which would see canada fully adopt the policies set out in the united nations ’ family planning and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development data booklet , the canadian population in 2100 could be only 37 . 1 million and the fertility rate could be a paltry 1 . 37 . that , the experts say , would have serious repercussions for not only canada but also all the other economies of the world . policy options “ a sustained ( total fertility rate ) lower than the replacement level in many countries , including china and india , would have economic , social , environmental , and geopolitical consequences , ” they state . “ policy options to adapt to continued low fertility , while sustaining and enhancing female reproductive health , will be crucial in the years to come . ” enter immigration . the study ’ s authors tout liberal immigration policies that already exist in countries like canada as being a ready solution to the economic hardships that would otherwise be caused by a declining population . “ for high - income countries with fertility rates lower than the replacement level , the most immediate solution is liberal immigration policies . among high - income countries , canada , australia , new zealand , and the ( united states of america ) have consistently pursued this approach in the past 30 years , ” the study states . “ as long as these immigration policies continue , our reference scenario showed sustained population growth and workforce expansion in these countries , with concomitant economic growth . ” but not everyone is on board with liberal immigration policies . in the united states , these policies have faced a political backlash in the past few years . and japan , hungary , slovakia , the baltic states , and several other countries have so far chosen not to boost immigration as a way to deal with their declines in population . “ in these societies , so far , the desire to maintain a linguistic and culturally homogeneous society has outweighed the economic , fiscal , and geopolitical risks of declining populations , ” state the experts . working - age populationthe study , funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation , states that liberal immigration with effective assimilation into these societies is the best strategy for economic growth , fiscal stability , and geopolitical security . “ some countries with fertility lower than replacement level , such as the usa , australia , and canada , will probably maintain their working - age populations through net immigration , ” state the authors of the study . “ our forecasts for a shrinking global population have positive implications for the environment , climate change , and food production , but possible negative implications for labour forces , economic growth , and social support systems in parts of the world with the greatest fertility declines . ” the united nations ’ sustainable development guidelines booklet calls on all countries to up their commitments to abortion , contraception and other reproductive healthcare for women . “ access to family planning is not only related to women ’ s reproductive rights and the reduction of unintended pregnancies , but also to improved health and nutritional status of children , brought about by longer birth spacing and the reduction in maternal mortality , ” states the un ’ s family planning and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development data booklet . “ redefining the global strategy for achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health - care services and identifying possible avenues for improved access is important to guarantee and improve the progress of countries that are most in need , ” maintains the international organization . 
__label__no_relevant emotional wellness overlooked when it comes to immigrants and refugees thriving in new lives housing and employment are usually the two most immediate needs talked about for foreign newcomers to calgary . but experts in the settlement field say another huge component to making a successful start is being overlooked : emotional wellness , especially in women . a conference in calgary will spend the next two days focused on that issue and how it can be moved farther up the long ladder of priorities for immigrants from faraway countries and the agencies that help them once they arrive . researchers , agencies , practitioners and newcomers themselves will get together at calgary ' s central library on wednesday and thursday to take a closer look at the topic . organizers hope participants leave with some new ways of thinking about the role of emotional wellness in settlement and integration . newcomers don ' t have to pay to access the conference , which includes free child care on - site . " we want to differentiate emotional wellness from clinical mental health conditions like ptsd and depression . the majority of cases in the settlement experience are around adjusting to a new environment and the stresses involved , " said cesar suva , director of research and development at the immigrant education society ( ties ) in calgary . the immigrant education society is one of the groups behind the conference , along with the university of calgary ' s faculty of nursing . it ' s being funded by a status of women alberta community grant . cesar suva with the immigrant education society says the conference this week will highlight emotional wellness , which is often overlooked as a factor for success in making a new start in a new country . ( dan mcgarvey / cbc ) we want to connect people working in the same area so they can share experiences and ideas , maybe start new areas of research and knowledge and new initiatives , " said suva . the conference will bring together ceos of settlement organizations for a town hall , as well as a leadership panel involving input from politicians . " wellness facilitates finding a job , becoming part of a new community and learning a new language . if you don ' t have emotional wellness , it becomes a barrier , " said suva . women in particular can struggle with accessing help when they need it . some are worried it might affect their status or cause financial problems . others worry about cultural beliefs and stigma around mental health . then there ' s sharing their problems in a new language . suva says if you struggle with emotional wellness , everything can take longer , hindering successful integration and causing economic isolation . " it revolves around removing the stigma , making those connections , building social ties and easing that whole process of economic and social integration , " suva said . moving to a new country can be difficult and stressful for many reasons . it could be leaving family and friends back home or being unfamiliar with new surroundings , culture and processes in the early days , weeks , months and years . " being an immigrant myself and a woman , i understand . i had the same journey and i understand what women are going through , " said noha eltanahi , a settlement counsellor with ties who came to canada from egypt . women coming from the other side of the world often don ' t have the power in families and partnerships , creating stress at home . noha eltanahi says the focus on maintaining and talking about women ’ s emotional wellness can lead to more successful settlement by newcomer families . ( dan mcgarvey / cbc ) " when they come here , they find out women have a lot of rights here , and just that can lead to problems with their spouse because the other person is used to having the upper hand , " said eltanahi . eltanahi says that in one group she worked with recently from rural areas , the women traditionally stayed home while the men worked , with some women taking education while at home . that led to quicker success for the women in learning english and other skills in canada compared with the men in the family , who then became embarrassed when their wives became the english speakers , communicators and family leaders after arriving here . even the frustration of mundane housekeeping tasks like banking and connecting and paying for utilities can be a big stress as a newcomer . eltanahi says it ' s important for newcomers to share experiences and talk through their problems and concerns and share their stresses . one panel at this week ' s conference will bring together newcomer women from different prairie cities , including saskatoon and winnipeg , to do just that , discussing their experiences unique to starting a new life in western canada . tickets to the conference are sold out but newcomers who have lived in canada fewer than five years can contact ties for free admission .

paid workers in part - time , temporary and more precarious jobs were much more likely to lose their jobs or the majority of their hours than those in higher - paid , more secure jobs . younger workers , recent immigrants , women — particularly mothers of younger children — and workers who lack the protection of a union were hardest hit . understanding the highly unequal impacts of the current crisis on b . c . workers is crucial in designing effective and equitable solutions as we look to rebuild the provincial economy . public investments in the recovery must promote job creation in sectors and positions that employ the types of workers who suffered the worst labour market impacts . this will require significant investments in programs that enable all british columbians to fully participate in the economy by expanding access to affordable , safe child care and seniors care , and by enabling unemployed and underemployed workers to access low -

wage workers . half of b . c . workers who earned minimum wage or slightly above ( the bottom wage 10 per cent ) lost their jobs or hours , compared to fewer than one in 10 among higher - paid workers ( $29 to $48 per hour ) . half of all b . c . ’ s job losses were concentrated in the lowest - paid 20 per cent of workers ( under $17 per hour ) . these workers are disproportionately women , racialized and indigenous and recent immigrants . only four per cent of bc ’ s total job losses were shouldered by those in the top 40 per cent of the wage distribution ( earning over $29 per hour ) . the heavy impact on workers at the lower end of the income ladder isn ’ t surprising given the industries most disrupted by the pandemic . three - quarters of those who lost their jobs between february and may were employed in one of five industries : accommodation and food services , retail , construction , information , culture and recreation and a sector called “ other services , ” which includes personal services , repair and maintenance , domestic workers ( including nannies , cleaners and gardeners ) and most charities and non - profits . in addition , 43 per cent of the b . c . workers who lost the majority of their hours between february and may worked in one of these five industries . 2 . non - unionized workers were much harder hit . more than a quarter of non -

hit sectors have lower unionization rates . expanding access to unionization for lower - paid , precarious workers could improve job security and protections to b . c . ’ s most vulnerable workers and should be a key plank of the recovery . 3 . young workers , particularly young women , saw staggering job losses . workers under 25 in b . c . were three times as likely as workers aged 25 to 54 to suffer job losses , with one in three young worker jobs ( 34 per cent ) evaporating between february and may . however , the average job loss among youth hides enormous gender differences . young women under 25 experienced by far the worst job losses with a 41 - per - cent drop in employment compared to 27 per cent for their male peers . the covid - 19 recession has been dubbed a she - cession because women were much more likely than men to lose their job in march . while layoffs among men caught up in april , men have seen a faster jobs recovery in may . in b . c . , women saw a 16 - per - cent decline in employment between february and may compared to a decline of 12 per cent for men . further , women were more likely to lose their jobs , whereas men were more likely to have the majority of their hours cut while remaining employed . this difference was particularly pronounced among younger workers . 4 . one in three recent immigrants lost their job . among recent immigrants in b . c . — those who have had permanent resident status in canada for less than 10 years—the magnitude of job losses was nearly three times as high as those experienced by more established immigrants and non - immigrants . immigrant women were more likely to lose their jobs than immigrant men , who were more likely to experience cuts in their hours but keep their jobs . 5 . mothers saw significantly larger job losses than fathers , especially those with young children . school and child - care closures during the pandemic have imposed additional challenges for workers with children . among working parents 25 to 54 , those with children under six were much more likely to experience losses in jobs and hours — mothers in particular . ( working parents make up about 43 per cent of the total b . c . workforce aged 25 to 54 . ) although the government introduced job - protected unpaid leave for parents who needed to care for their children while schools and child - care providers were closed , a significant share of mothers with children under six working in february appear to have lost their jobs ( 16 per cent ) . in addition , parents of younger children were more likely to have lost the majority of their hours than their peers . going into the pandemic , women in b . c . already had a lower workforce participation rate than men and the gap was largest for women with children under six due to the lack of access to quality , affordable child care in our province . prioritizing safe and accessible child care for working parents over the summer and fall is essential if we are going to rebuild the province ’ s economy and ensure young families can weather the recession . 6 . single parents with young children were even harder hit . half of b . c . ’ s working single parents with children under six lost their jobs or hours . this group was small to begin with due to lack of affordable child - care spaces . not surprisingly , single parents were much more likely to experience job losses than those in two - parent families where child care responsibilities can be shared . children in single - parent families are already at much higher risk of poverty than their peers in two - parent families , and the gap is likely to grow unless b . c . makes significant investments in expanding access to safe , affordable child care . even if most of b . c . ’ s unemployed single parents are receiving the cerb for now , it is not at all clear that they will qualify for employment insurance once cerb is phased out in the fall . even if they do , their benefits may be too low to keep them out of poverty . 7 . workers in small businesses were more likely to lose their jobs . when a pandemic hits , working moms pay the price read morenearly half of all b . c . job losses between february and may were concentrated among those working for small employers ( fewer than 20 staff ) , even though only 20 per cent of workers were employed by a small business . this is hardly surprising . small businesses and non - profit employers are less likely to have operational reserves to absorb the costs of pandemic closures or slowdowns — even with wage subsidies — and have been forced to lay off more of their workers than large corporations . not included in the chart above are self - employed workers . about half of b . c . ’ s self - employed workers are unincorporated and have no employees . this group reported very high losses in hours , with more than one in three losing the majority of their hours . it is critically important to continue monitoring the jobs recovery for this particularly vulnerable group of workers as the cerb is phased out , because they will not qualify for existing employment insurance programs . 8 . indigenous men are more likely to have lost jobs . statistics about job loss among indigenous workers are only available in the form of three - month moving averages , and there ’ s no data on reduced hours . but comparing the average employment numbers for march , april and may with those from december , january and february can help us pinpoint which groups and regions were hit harder by the job market losses , although these numbers should be viewed with some caution . indigenous workers were slightly more likely to lose their jobs than non - indigenous workers in b . c . , particularly indigenous men . indigenous and non - indigenous women experienced similar rates of job loss , higher than non - indigenous men .

__label__no_relevant don ' t let the pandemic erase decades of progress for girls ' education covid - 19 has made access to education a unifying , global concern . at one point , over 90 per cent of students worldwide were affected , including 743 million girls . more than 100 million of those girls live in developing countries where accessing education was already difficult . given the tenuous foothold many girls had on education in the first place , this pandemic could wipe out decades of progress and set back the future of an entire generation . girls ’ education is one of the best investments towards ending global poverty and achieving gender equality . according to the world bank , barriers that block girls from completing 12 years of education cost countries $15 trillion to $30 trillion in lost lifetime productivity and earnings . education is transformative for a girl : it delays marriage and pregnancy , improves her health and the health of her children if she has them , and increases her agency and decision - making power . with families shouldering new economic pressures caused by covid - 19 lockdowns , along with anxiety , isolation and hunger , the barriers to girls ’ education have grown , including : cost : even where school is free , parents must pay for school supplies . as families ’ incomes dwindle , the costs may become too great , exacerbated by harmful gender norms that undervalue girls ’ education as compared to boys . even where school is free , parents must pay for school supplies . as families ’ incomes dwindle , the costs may become too great , exacerbated by harmful gender norms that undervalue girls ’ education as compared to boys . child , early and forced marriage : some parents marry off their young daughters believing it will protect them and reduce family economic pressures , resulting in many violations of their rights , including ending their education . globally , 12 million girls are married before the age of 18 every year and unfpa projects the covid - 19 pandemic may result in 13 million additional child marriages . keeping girls in school is one of the best ways of preventing early and forced marriage . some parents marry off their young daughters believing it will protect them and reduce family economic pressures , resulting in many violations of their rights , including ending their education . globally , 12 million girls are married before the age of 18 every year and unfpa projects the covid - 19 pandemic may result in 13 million additional child marriages . keeping girls in school is one of the best ways of preventing early and forced marriage . unequal expectations around household chores and care work , caused by harmful gender norms : this burden is largely falling on girls , taking away study time and causing girls to fall behind or drop out . globally , women undertake more than three quarters of unpaid care work . this burden is largely falling on girls , taking away study time and causing girls to fall behind or drop out . globally , women undertake more than three quarters of unpaid care work . gender - based violence and pregnancy : girls isolated at home and out of school face increased risks of violence and sexual exploitation , escalating their risk of pregnancy and making it impossible to continue their studies . out - of - school girls have a higher risk of pregnancy and in many parts of the world , pregnant girls are prohibited from attending school . following the ebola crisis of 2014 , where schools were closed for months , there was a 65 per cent increase in adolescent pregnancy in sierra leone . when schools close , children lose more than education — school meal programs , sexual and reproductive health and rights information , contraception and menstrual products . they also lose daily contact with friends , teachers and systems designed to protect them . the longer girls remain cut off from education , the less likely they will return to school . from there , the setback to global poverty and gender equality goals — and most importantly , to realizing their rights — begins , deepening existing gender gaps . to stop the setback , there must be equitable access to quality , gender - responsive education . governments and decision - makers must be flexible , ensuring equal rights for all children to education , taking their unique gendered needs into account . for example , barriers to girls ’ education must be swiftly removed , including discriminatory policies preventing pregnant girls from attending school . " girls ’ education is one of the best investments towards ending global poverty and achieving gender equality . " where learning goes online , the gendered digital divide must be narrowed , including providing free and low - cost mobile internet access and digital literacy training for girls . low - tech learning options must be provided , such as radio and television broadcasts or sending learning materials home , coupled with regular information and at - home - learning guidance for caregivers . community sensitization on girls ’ education , shared domestic responsibilities and preventing and responding to gender - based violence and child marriage is vital to protect education gains for girls . finally , girls and young women in all their diversity must be consulted to help shape education policy and delivery that directly affect them . everyone has the power to make a difference . governments like canada ’ s must continue to invest in girls ’ education and champion girls ’ voices and participation . the canadian public can support organizations working in girls ’ education and directly contribute to keeping girls in school . i ’ ve seen the public rally behind girls ’ rights and i ’ m asking them to do this once again to stop the setback . covid - 19 could leave the world far worse off , or it could be the catalyst to address long - ignored inequalities . now is the time to prioritize girls ’ education , for the benefit of their families and communities , for the benefit of reaching global goals to end poverty , and most importantly — for girls themselves , to unleash their full potential . a better post - covid world cannot exist without empowered , educated girls . 
__label__no_relevant canada ' s fastest - growing crime problem is in wetaskiwin , alta . a newcomer might receive several different tours of wetaskiwin when reporting on crime in the central alberta city . susan kokas , a local resident , starts her excursion by driving past one of the commercial buildings where she once worked as a cleaner . pointing to trees at the end of the cul - de - sac , she says a young first nations woman was found dead there a couple of years ago . a self - described “ poor ” resident who ’ s lived close to the town ’ s troubles , kokas ticks off a list of petty , seemingly pointless crimes she ’ s endured , like the theft of paint cans she ’ d kept in her backyard while doing artwork ; local gangs made a habit of walking through the alleyway behind the modest home where kokas rented a basement suite , grabbing whatever they saw . but what rattled her most was the fatal stabbing of a young man in a parking lot mere blocks from her home—a killing that prompted her to hold a “ violence vigil ” in a nearby park last fall . about 20 people showed up . kevin lonsdale , the city ’ s deputy mayor , begins his sightseeing on the opposite side of town , driving past the local hockey arena and a football field where happy - go - lucky kids are running around as parents dutifully wait for practice to end . his tour showcases a city that ’ s only an hour ’ s drive south of edmonton , with a population of about 12 , 600 , yet still retains its small - town vibe and prairie roots . it ’ s a place where lonsdale spends his spare time coaching minor football and where every patron at a local restaurant appears to know his name . he talks about how perfectly safe he feels in this community . his daughter and her family live about a block from a reputedly dangerous dead - end street , he says , but neither he nor they worry about their safety . “ if you want to look for trouble , you ’ ll find it , ” lonsdale says . “ but every city has crime—unless you ’ ve got superman . ” suffice to say , when both tour guides are told that statistics canada data shows wetaskiwin had the fastest - growing crime severity index score in the country between 2012 and 2017 , the dichotomy between their responses exposes how polarized attitudes in the community have become toward crime . in lonsdale ’ s eyes , wetaskiwin remains a livable place with all the amenities and attractions befitting a city of its size . “ this town ’ s been good to me and my family , ” he says . to kokas and others , such reassurances ignore what data and lived experience have been telling them for years : there ’ s a crime problem here , it ’ s getting worse , and it ’ s increasingly hard to pretend otherwise . the first thing an outsider notices is the abundance of car dealerships on what ’ s known in wetaskiwin as the “ auto mile . ” it ’ s the reason people from across the province make trips here when they ’ re in the market for a new ride . as the famous advertising jingle goes : “ cars cost less in wetaskiwin . ” local rcmp , though , are more invested in getting a handle on stolen cars . property crime is a growing concern , especially motor vehicle theft . when wetaskiwin rcmp insp . keith durance instructed a colleague to read every file on motor vehicle thefts in 2017 , they found that 38 . 5 per cent of cases in the city involved keys being easily accessible to the criminal : vehicles left running ; an unlocked car with keys hidden under a sun visor ; keys left on a nail hanging in an unlocked garage . ( in the surrounding rural area , it was 42 per cent . ) many residents still have that small - town canadian mentality—they don ’ t lock their cars or doors , says durance . “ it ’ s not right that someone is going to come to your house and steal your car , ” he says . “ but if you locked the door and kept the keys in your pocket , they wouldn ’ t be stealing it . ” so the rcmp detachment is starting a “ lock your car ” campaign . but addressing property crime also requires boots on the ground , and for durance , that meant bolstering his crime - reduction unit by three officers . “ when i first got here [18 months ago] , it was a one - person team—which doesn ’ t make a team , ” he says . a major part of the unit ’ s strategy is to focus on prolific offenders , durance says , including those who might be on bail or released on probation . a dedicated team can not only compile analytics but also keep up with mundane but meaningful things like curfew checks on parolees or suspects out on bail . with about eight per cent of the criminals accounting for 80 per cent of the property crime in town , durance reasons that concentrating on those frequent offenders will produce a steep decline in property crime . it ’ s a good start , but the main driver behind the increase in the city ’ s crime - severity score is serious violent crime , such as assault with a weapon and assault causing bodily harm , which more than doubled between 2012 to 2017 , from 43 offences to 94 . aggravated assault rose from one offence to 10 . there were also two homicides last year , whereas the city saw just one ( in 2014 ) over the previous five - year period . writer aaron hutchins discusses how wetaskiwin can handle canada ’ s fastest - growing crime problem , on the big story podcast . altogether , wetaskiwin ’ s crime severity index numbers peg it as the most dangerous city in alberta—and the third most dangerous in the country . ( maclean ’ s uses statistics canada ’ s annual crime data to produce a report ranking canada ’ s 237 population centres with 10 , 000 or more people . statscan ’ s crime severity index is a measure of both the number and seriousness of crimes in a given area . the most dangerous place in canada , according to the index , remains north battleford , sask . —a city that maclean ’ s profiled last year . it shares some demographic features with wetaskiwin , including population size and status as a hub to surrounding rural communities . ) but tyler gandam , the mayor of wetaskiwin , stresses that the city ’ s growing crime - severity numbers should not be interpreted to mean law - abiding residents are in danger . “ if there ’ s a rise in the number of assaults , it ’ s between people who know each other , ” he says . “ they ’ re not random acts of aggression or people getting robbed . i think that ’ s where residents might feel more scared seeing us ranked no . 1 in the province . but they ’ re not in any danger of getting assaulted . it ’ s two people who have a beef with each other already . ” no local politician who spoke with maclean ’ s would say wetaskiwin has a crime problem . if anything , they argue , the area has a crime severity index problem . the number is not , says city councillor patricia macquarrie , a measure of community safety : “ it wasn ’ t that overall crime in the city grew from eighth worst [in the country] to third worst . it ’ s a case of very few , but very major , instances increasing our severity to that level because of our [smaller] population . ” the small - population argument is echoed at the city ’ s rcmp detachment . “ it doesn ’ t take long for the crime severity to ramp up , particularly if you ’ re having a certain type of crime rearing its head , ” says durance . “ we had 28 robberies in january and february this year , which is unheard of . so i suspect with next year ’ s crime severity , we ’ ll be up there again because of the armed robberies in january and february . ” durance is quick to point out that his team solved 26 of those robberies . of course , the logic of that math also means a smaller city can , through luck or good management , turn around its ranking . in 2012 , estevan , sask . , ranked as the 20th most dangerous place in the country . when police chief paul ladouceur came to the city of 11 , 000 two years later , the biggest problem was drugs and related enterprises . “ we had massage parlours , [biker] clubhouses and organized crime , ” he says . “ no community likes to say , ‘we have a drug problem . ’ ” ladouceur could see that cocaine and crack use were the root cause of much of the city ’ s spinoff crime—break and enters , robberies , home invasions , offences involving weapons . his answer was to apply a principle of business to policing : “ we ’ re in the business of public safety , and a good business follows up with its customers , ” he says . it ’ s something police forces don ’ t all do well . many residents who call to report a suspected break - in down the street never hear from the cops again . in estevan , says ladouceur , “ we make a very strong point of reaching back out and saying : ‘hi , you called with information on a possible impaired driver last night . we just wanted to thank you because we caught that person , they blew well over the legal limit , and you likely saved somebody ’ s life . congratulations . ’ ” it goes a long way . not only do residents appreciate police following through with the information , he says , it makes them more likely to report other crimes in the future . ladouceur credits that trust - building for helping make estevan the city with the fastest - shrinking crime - severity number in canada . it ’ s 91st in this year ’ s maclean ’ s rankings . the biggest step , according to the chief , was facing up to the truth . “ we told the town , ‘we have a drug problem—and we need your help . ’ it is amazing when you ask questions bluntly . the calls start coming . a good portion of that is trust—trust that the police will do something . ” wetaskiwin , to be sure , is not a scene from mad max . friendly locals are out shopping , eating in restaurants and walking down main street . but ask a handful of random strangers about crime , and you ’ ll get a story . jennifer threefingers says she was assaulted in her wetaskiwin home two months ago . the patio door was open and “ this guy—we know him but he ’ s not a good friend—walked in , ” she says . “ he pulled my hair and kicked me in the face . it was ugly . ” she says she reported the incident and the man was arrested . larry jensen , a 54 - year - old who stopped to chat outside his low - income apartment on his way home from work , wishes he could move to a quieter , cleaner and safer neighbourhood in wetaskiwin ’ s north end . but he can ’ t afford it on his wages as a mechanic ’ s assistant . “ this is a seedy town , ” says jensen , who ’ s lived in wetaskiwin since the early 1990s . “ i don ’ t like to say that , but that ’ s what it is . when the sun goes down , the crazies come out . ” the windows on his old dodge were smashed on one occasion . another time , the tires were slashed . jensen laments the proliferation of liquor stores and pawn shops in the city . while taking out his trash at night , he says , he has heard the sound of people trying to open car doors—and the quiet exclamation , “ this one ’ s open ! ” though he stands about six foot five , he says he ’ s quick to turn back indoors : “ i ’ m not going to go be some crime - fighter . ” teresa callihoo , whose children are indigenous , says there ’ s a perception that first nations people from the neighbouring city of maskwacis are the perpetrators of most of the crime in wetaskiwin . it ’ s true , she says , that gang violence began “ ramping up ” in maskwacis a decade ago , when she was working for the city of wetaskiwin on a crime prevention program . several years ago , one of the reserves passed a bylaw to evict known gang members living there . but she notes that maskwacis , which serves four reserves , was also home to the ermineskin indian residential school that shut down in 1973 . “ the intergenerational trauma—that ’ s what we ’ re seeing playing out in [wetaskiwin] with the crime , homelessness and addiction , ” says callihoo , who lives in wetaskiwin with her kids . “ i think what is perceived as inaction in [wetaskiwin] is maybe just cautious planning—how to handle the optics of a rising crime rate without alarming people , and how to maintain the relationship between our community and maskwacis . ” a growing homelessness problem doesn ’ t help , and is made all the more complicated as the city doesn ’ t have a shelter . the city is working on building a friendship centre to help with shelter , food security and social services for those in need , but it ’ s far from breaking ground . in the meantime , residents complain about the homeless—most of them first nations people who are found sleeping inside the entryways to apartment buildings or bank branches in a place where winter temperatures plunge below - 20° c . photos of their makeshift sleeping quarters often wind up on a “ wetaskiwin rant and rave ” facebook page . this fall , the city put up wooden shed - like structures in an empty field next to the walmart to help protect the homeless from heat and rain . they ’ d previously been used as dugouts at the local baseball diamond , but such structures are also used in the area as shelters for cattle . proponents argued it was at least something , anything , to help , and locals would venture out to the field to offer blankets or water . “ those sheds were a positive effort , ” says sherry greene , who ’ s originally from maskwacis . “ my brother is homeless . we worried about him every night . we knew those sheds were helping him . ” but critics argued the makeshift solution wasn ’ t enough—never mind the optics of using livestock sheds for people . in any event , mere weeks after they were installed , they burned down . a fire spread from a burn - barrel brought close to the structures for warmth . in town , some of the homeless are known as the “ regulators . ” ( the origins of the name aren ’ t clear , but according to old west lore , billy the kid ’ s gang used it . ) for the most part , they are harmless , but the rcmp ’ s durance says “ these regulator folks ” take up a disproportionate amount of police resources : “ they ’ re spending the night in the drunk tank because they ’ re out causing problems and we have to scoop them up . this is a social problem , not a policing problem . ” on a recent weekday morning , a group of unemployed first nations men sit in an empty patch of land behind a liquor store . “ we ’ re just bored , ” says cary mcgilvery , who is originally from st . paul , alta . , but has lived in maskwacis for 26 years . “ like me today , i came over because i had nothing to do at home . ” mcgilvery seems resigned to his situation . “ it ’ s a lack of jobs , lack of employment and lack of communication with the reserve . ” as he speaks , a man shows up and strikes up a conversation with one of the other men sitting around . “ did you get charged ? ” “ for what ? ” the other replies . “ that knife . ” “ oh . no . ” the newcomer then recognizes someone with a notepad , introduces himself , learns he ’ s speaking with a journalist and walks away . no word on what happened to the knife . “ our regulators will often pass out and get robbed . some are elderly and not in great physical condition , so they started carrying knives on them , ” says rcmp cpl . laura mcgilvray . “ but if they ’ re carrying a weapon and pull it out , now we ’ re responding to a weapons offence . ” wetaskiwin has added three rcmp positions over the past two years . durance says he ’ s put in a request for three more for next year . “ when i ask the city for more resources , it ’ s a big ask , ” he says . “ policing is expensive , and wetaskiwin is not a bustling metropolis . ” the mayor says he ’ s budgeted for two new rcmp members . but macquarrie would also like to address crime prevention through environmental design . “ i want to see more lights , ” the third - term councillor says . “ i want to see us restructuring our infrastructure to ensure we have spaces in the community with good sightlines , that people are accessing and feel safe . ” what might that look like ? kokas drives past jubilee park , where she sees her former neighbour out walking the dog . the pup and its master are relatively easy to spot as lights shine down on a chilly october evening . and this is worth pointing out , kokas says , because jubilee “ used to be crackhead park . nobody would go there . i never went there . it was scary . ” on this , she speaks with authority : at the time , she lived two houses away from it . now , she says , things have changed . the city added lighting , benches and garbage cans , and trimmed down the high hedges so anyone driving down main street can see into the park . kokas credits the changes as one of the more successful initiatives to address the growing concern over crime—a flicker of encouragement . but she won ’ t be wandering the park with regularity any time soon . the “ violence vigil ” she held last year drew the local mla , but no city politician . a facebook page she launched , called “ citizens for a safe wetaskiwin , ” didn ’ t gather much steam , so she shut it down . worse , she says , being vocal about local crime made her a frequent target on the “ rant and rave ” facebook page . so she finally gave up and moved a few kilometres out of town . “ you get exhausted , ” she says . “ i was tired of all the ugly . ”

__label__no_relevant our parents , the russian spies | the world weekly our parents , the russian spies | the world weeklytim foley turned 20 on 27 june 2010 . to celebrate , his parents took him and his younger brother alex out for lunch at an indian restaurant not far from their home in cambridge , massachusetts . both brothers were born in canada , but for the past decade the family had lived in the us . the boys ’ father , donald heathfield , had studied in paris and at harvard , and now had a senior role at a consultancy firm based in boston . their mother , tracey foley , had spent many years focused on raising her children , before taking a job as a real estate agent . to those who knew them , they seemed a very ordinary american family , albeit with canadian roots and a penchant for foreign travel . both brothers were fascinated by asia , a favoured holiday destination , and the parents encouraged their sons to be inquisitive about the world : alex was only 16 , but had just returned from a six - month student exchange in singapore . after a buffet lunch , the four returned home and opened a bottle of champagne to toast tim reaching his third decade . the brothers were tired ; they had thrown a small house party the night before to mark alex ’ s return from singapore , and tim planned to go out later . after the champagne , he went upstairs to message his friends about the evening ’ s plans . there came a knock at the door , and tim ’ s mother called up that his friends must have come early , as a surprise . at the door , she was met by a different kind of surprise altogether : a team of armed , black - clad men holding a battering ram . they streamed into the house , screaming , “ fbi ! ” another team entered from the back ; men dashed up the stairs , shouting at everyone to put their hands in the air . upstairs , tim had heard the knock and the shouting , and his first thought was that the police could be after him for underage drinking : nobody at the party the night before had been 21 , and boston police took alcohol regulations seriously . when he emerged on to the landing , it became clear the fbi was here for something far more serious . the two brothers watched , stunned , as their parents were put in handcuffs and driven away in separate black cars . tim and alex were left behind with a number of agents , who said they needed to begin a 24 - hour forensic search of the home ; they had prepared a hotel room for the brothers . one of the men told them their parents had been arrested on suspicion of being “ unlawful agents of a foreign government ” . alex presumed there had been some mistake – the wrong house , or a mix - up over his father ’ s consultancy work . donald travelled frequently for his job ; perhaps this had been confused with espionage . at worst , perhaps he had been tricked by an international client . even when the brothers heard on the radio a few days later that 10 russian spies had been rounded up across the us , in an fbi operation dubbed ghost stories , they remained sure there had been a terrible mistake . but the fbi had not made a mistake , and the truth was so outlandish , it defied comprehension . not only were their parents indeed russian spies , they were russians . the man and woman the boys knew as mom and dad really were their parents , but their names were not donald heathfield and tracey foley . those were canadians who had died long ago , as children ; their identities had been stolen and adopted by the boys ’ parents . their real names were andrei bezrukov and elena vavilova . they were both born in the soviet union , had undergone training in the kgb and been dispatched abroad as part of a soviet programme of deep - cover secret agents , known in russia as the “ illegals ” . after a slow - burning career building up an ordinary north american background , the pair were now active agents for the svr , the foreign spy agency of modern russia and a successor to the kgb . they , along with eight other agents , had been betrayed by a russian spy who had defected to the americans . the fbi indictment detailing their misdeeds was a catalogue of espionage cliches : dead drops , brush - pasts , coded messages and plastic bags stuffed with crisp dollar bills . the footage of a plane carrying the 10 touching down at vienna airport , to be swapped for four russians who had been held in russian prisons on charges of spying for the west , brought back memories of the cold war . the media had a field day with the bond - girl looks of 28 - year - old anna chapman , one of two russians arrested not to have pretended to be of western origin ; she worked as an international estate agent in manhattan . russia didn ’ t know whether to be embarrassed or emboldened : its agents had been busted , but what other country would think of mounting such a complex , slow - drip espionage operation in the first place ? for alex and tim , the geopolitics behind the spy swap was the least of their worries . the pair had grown up as ordinary canadians , and now discovered they were the children of russian spies . ahead of them was a long flight to moscow , and an even longer emotional and psychological journey . * * * nearly six years since the fbi raid , i meet alex in a cafe near the kiev railway station in moscow . he is now officially alexander vavilov ; his brother is timofei vavilov , though many of their friends still use their old surname , foley . alex is 21 , his still - boyish looks offset by a serious manner and businesslike clothes : black v - neck over a crisp white shirt . a gentle north american lilt and the careful aspiration of final consonants give him the unplaceable accent of those who have been schooled internationally – in paris , singapore and the us . these days , he speaks enough russian to order lunch , but is by no means fluent . he is studying in a european city and is here to visit his parents ; tim works in finance in asia . ( in the interests of privacy , both brothers have asked me not to reveal details about their working lives . ) since 2010 , they have made a conscious decision to avoid the media . they have agreed to talk to me now , alex explains , because they are fighting a legal battle to win back their canadian citizenship , stripped from them six years ago . they believe it is unfair and illegal that they are expected to answer for the sins of their parents , and have decided to tell their story for the first time . as we eat khachapuri , a georgian bread stuffed with gooey cheese , alex recalls the days after the raid . he and tim stayed up until the early hours in the hotel room the fbi had provided , trying to understand what was going on . when they went home the next day , they found every piece of electronic equipment , every photograph and document had been taken . the fbi ’ s search and seizure warrant lists 191 items removed from the foley / heathfield residence , including computers , mobile phones , photographs and medicines . they even took tim and alex ’ s playstation . news crews held a vigil outside ; the brothers sat inside with the blinds drawn , their phones and computers confiscated . early next morning tim snuck out to get online at the public library and try to find a lawyer for his parents . all the family bank accounts had been frozen , leaving the boys with just the money they had in their pockets and whatever they could borrow from friends . fbi agents drove them to an initial court hearing in boston , where their parents were informed of the charges . there was a brief meeting with their mother inside jail . alex tells me he did not ask her what she and his father were accused of . this seems surprising , i say : surely he must have been dying to ask ? “ here ’ s the thing : i knew that if i was going to testify in court , the less i knew , the better . i didn ’ t want to cloud my opinion with anything . i didn ’ t want to ask questions , because it was obvious people were listening , ” he says . a boisterous group of women are celebrating a birthday at the next table , and he raises his voice . “ i refused to let myself be convinced they were actually guilty of anything , because i realised the case would probably draw on for a long time . they were facing life in prison , and if i was to testify , i would have to completely believe they were innocent . ” the family had been planning a month - long summer break in paris , moscow and turkey ; their mother told them to escape the media circus and fly to russia . after a stopover in paris , alex and tim boarded a plane to moscow , unsure of what to expect on arrival . they had never been to russia before . “ it was a really terrifying moment , ” alex recalls . “ you ’ re sitting on the plane , you have a few hours to kill and you don ’ t know what ’ s coming . you just sit there and think and think . ” as the brothers disembarked , they were met at the plane door by a group of people who introduced themselves in english as colleagues of their parents . they told the brothers to trust them , and led them outside the terminal to a van . “ they showed us photos of our parents in their 20s in uniform , photos of them with medals . that was the moment when i thought , ‘ok , this is real . ’ until that moment , i ’ d refused to believe any of it was true , ” alex says . he and tim were taken to an apartment and told to make themselves at home ; one of their minders spent the next few days showing them around moscow ; they took them to museums , even the ballet . an uncle and a cousin the brothers had no idea existed paid a visit ; a grandmother also dropped by , but she spoke no english and the boys not a word of russian . it would be a few days before their parents would arrive , having admitted at a court hearing in new york on 8 july that they were russian nationals . an exchange was already in the offing , and they arrived in moscow , via vienna , on 9 july , still wearing the orange prison jumpsuits they had been given in america . my face must give away some of my amazement : how does a 16 - year - old process such an extraordinary turn of events ? alex smirks at me wryly . “ typical high school identity crisis , right ? ” alex and tim ’ s father was born andrei olegovich bezrukov , in krasnoyarsk region , in the heart of siberia . since his return to moscow in 2010 , he has given just a handful of interviews to russian media outlets , mainly concerning the more recent work he has done as a geopolitical analyst . details of his past , or that of his wife , elena vavilova , are scarce . alex tells me what he knows about his parents ’ recruitment , based on the little they have told him : “ they got recruited into it together , as a couple . they were promising , young , smart people , they were asked if they wanted to help their country and they said yes . they went through years of training and preparing . ” none of the 10 deportees has spoken publicly about their mission in the us , or their training by the svr or kgb . department s , which runs the illegals programme they were on , was the most secretive part of the kgb . one former “ illegal ” tells me his training in the late 1970s included two years in moscow with daily english lessons , taught by an american woman who had defected . he was also trained in other basics such as communicating in code and surveillance . all the training was done on a one - to - one basis : he never met other agents . the programme was the only one of its kind in international espionage . ( many assumed it had been stopped , until the 2010 fbi swoop . ) many intelligence agencies use agents operating without diplomatic cover ; some have recruited second - generation immigrants already living abroad , but the russians have been the only ones to train agents to pretend to be foreigners . canada was a common place for the illegals to go , to build up their “ legend ” of being an ordinary western citizen before being deployed to target countries , often the us or britain . during soviet times , the illegals had two main functions : to aid in communications between embassy kgb officers and their us sources ( an illegal would be less likely to be put under surveillance than a diplomat ) ; and to be sleeper cells for a potential “ special period ” – a war between the us and the soviet union . the illegals could then spring into action . the kgb sent the couple to canada in the 80s . in june 1990 , vavilova , under the assumed identity of tracey foley , gave birth to tim at the women ’ s college hospital in toronto . his first memories are of attending a french - language school in the city and visiting the warehouse of his dad ’ s company , diapers direct , a nappy delivery service . it was hardly james bond , but the work of an agent has always been more tortoise than hare – years spent painstakingly building up the legend . andrei bezrukov already had a degree from a soviet university , but “ donald heathfield ” had no educational records . between 1992 and 1995 , he studied for a bachelor ’ s degree in international economics at york university in toronto . in 1994 , alex was born ; a year later the family moved to paris . we don ’ t know whether this was on the orders of the svr , but it seems a safe assumption . donald studied for an mba at the école des ponts and the family lived frugally in a small flat not far from the eiffel tower ; both brothers shared the only bedroom while the parents slept on the sofa . as bezrukov and vavilova built up their story , the country that had recruited and trained them ceased to exist . the ideology of communism had failed ; the fearsome spy agency that had dispatched agents across the globe was discredited and renamed . under boris yeltsin , post - soviet russia seemed on the verge of becoming a failed state . but in 1999 , as the family planned a move from france to the us , a new man entered the kremlin who himself had a kgb background . in the subsequent years , he would work to make the kgb ’ s successors important and respected again . with the legend of a hardworking , well - educated canadian perfected over the years , heathfield got into harvard university ’ s kennedy school of government towards the end of that year , and was ready to deploy as an agent of the svr . he would be spying not for the soviet system that had trained him , but for the new russia of vladimir putin . heathfield and foley sent their sons to a bilingual french - english school in boston , so they could maintain their french and stay in touch with european culture . they could not teach their children about russia ; perhaps the emphasis on french was a way of ensuring their children were not “ ordinary ” americans without ringing alarm bells . at home , the family spoke a mixture of english and french . ( an online video of bezrukov , appearing in his post - deportation role as a political analyst , shows him speaking smooth north american with the faintest of twangs . ) when he completed his postgraduate degree at harvard , heathfield got a job working for global partners , a business development consultancy . i speak to tim on a sunday afternoon , talking to me on skype from his kitchen . he has the same facial features and careful parting as his younger brother , but his hair is blond rather than dark . looking back on his youth , he tells me his father worked hard , making frequent business trips . he encouraged his sons to read and educate themselves about the world , and “ was like a best friend to us ” . foley , tim says , was a “ soccer mom ” , picking her sons up from school and taking them to sports practice . when the boys were in their teens , she started work as a real estate agent . in 2008 , tim got a place at george washington university , in dc , to study international relations . he focused on asia , taking mandarin lessons and spending a semester in beijing . the same year , the family became naturalised americans , with us passports in addition to their canadian nationality . the brothers would never live in canada again ; alex had been one when they left toronto and tim only five – but both felt canadian . the family returned often to ski , and when the boys went on school trips from boston to montreal , they took pride in showing the other students around their “ home ” country . alex made a big fuss about his canadian background , because “ at high school you always want to go counterculture ” . tim describes their childhood as “ absolutely normal ” : the family was close and spent time together at weekends ; his parents had many friends . he has no recollection of them discussing russia or the soviet union ; they never ate russian food , and the closest tim says he came to a russian was a polite boy from kazakhstan at school . their parents did not discuss their childhood much , but this was how they had always been and the boys had little reason to question it . “ i never had anything close to a suspicion regarding my parents , ” alex says . in fact , he often felt disappointed by how boring and mundane they were : “ it seemed all my friends ’ parents led much more exciting and successful lives . ” little did he know . bezrukov and vavilova had been put under fbi surveillance soon after they moved to the us , probably because of a mole in the russian agency . excerpts from their 2010 indictment suggest the couple lived with a level of intrigue most people would assume exists only within the pages of a spy novel . one paragraph recounts an intercepted communication from moscow centre ( svr headquarters ) , explaining how vavilova should plan for a trip back to her motherland . she was to fly to paris and take the train to vienna , where she would pick up a fake british passport . “ very important : 1 . sign your passport on page 32 . train yourself to be able to reproduce your signature when necessary… in the passport you ’ ll get a memo with recommendation . pls , destroy the memo after reading . be well . ” their father , meanwhile , was using his work as a consultant to penetrate us political and business circles . it is not clear whether he managed to access classified material , but fbi intercepts reported a number of contacts with former and current american officials . in the few public remarks bezrukov has made about his job , he makes it sound more like that of a thinktank analyst than a super - spy . “ intelligence work is not about risky escapades , ” he told expert magazine in 2012 . “ if you behave like bond , you ’ ll last half a day , maybe a day . even if there was an imaginary safe where all the secrets are kept , by tomorrow half of them will be outdated and useless . the best kind of intelligence is to understand what your opponent will think tomorrow , not find out what he thought yesterday . ” bezrukov and vavilova communicated with the svr using digital steganography : they would post images online that contained messages hidden in the pixels , encoded using an algorithm written for them by the svr . a message the fbi believes was sent in 2007 to bezrukov by svr headquarters was decoded as follows : “ got your note and signal . no info in our files about e . f . , bt , dk , rr . agree with your proposal to use ‘farmer ’ to start building network of students in dc . your relationship with ‘parrot ’ looks very promising as a valid source of info from us power circles . to start working on him professionally we need all available details on his background , current position , habits , contacts , opportunities , etc . ” way back in 2001 , nearly a decade before her arrest , the fbi had searched a safe - deposit box belonging to tracey foley . there they found photographs of her in her 20s , one of which bore the cyrillic imprint of the soviet company that had printed it . the family home had been bugged , possibly for many years . the fbi knew the couple ’ s real identities , even if their own children did not , but the americans preferred to keep an eye on the russian spy ring , rather than make a move . why the fbi finally acted is unclear . one suggestion is that alexander poteyev , the svr officer believed to have betrayed the group , felt his cover was blown . he reportedly fled russia in the days before the arrests ; in 2011 , a russian court sentenced him to 25 years in prison for treason in absentia . another possibility is that one of the group was getting close to sensitive information . whatever the reason , in june 2010 the fbi decided to wrap up operation ghost stories and bust the russian spy ring . i speak to tim and alex many times , in person , over skype and email . they are not uncomfortable talking about their experiences , but neither do they enjoy it much . initially , they want to speak only about their court case in canada ; but gradually they open up , answering all my questions about their extraordinary family life . i have to admit there are some details that bother me . did they really never suspect a thing ? in 2012 , the wall street journal reported that unnamed us officials claimed an fbi bug placed at the family ’ s boston home had picked up the parents revealing their true identities to tim long before the arrest . furthermore , the officials said , his parents had told tim they wanted to groom him as a russian spy . a second - generation spy would be a much more impressive asset than first - generation illegals , who had built up personas that were solid but not impregnable to background checks . tim , according to the unnamed officials , agreed he would travel to moscow for svr training and even “ saluted mother russia ” . tim strenuously denies the story , insisting it was a total fabrication . “ why would a kid who grew up his whole life believing himself to be canadian , decide to risk life in prison for a country he had never been to nor had any ties to ? furthermore , why would my parents take a similar risk in telling their teenage son their identities ? ” the claim that he saluted mother russia is “ just as ridiculous as it sounds ” , tim says . he would be happy to answer the allegations in court , but it is impossible to argue with anonymous sources . when contacted by the guardian , the fbi declined to comment on the wall street journal article . there was another thing that bothered me : was it really just coincidence that the family had planned to travel to russia that summer , and that the brothers therefore had russian visas ? yes , alex says . “ it was very much my idea to go to russia . we had this world map at home and when you looked at the pins on it , you could see we ’ d been almost everywhere but russia , so i was very curious and i was pushing for it . it was just going to be one part of our summer trip . ” in hindsight , surely , that summer trip to paris , turkey and moscow must have looked rather different . when the family were reunited in moscow in july 2010 , did the boys ask their parents what the plan had been ? had they intended to reveal everything ? or were they really going to spend a week in moscow pretending not to understand a word spoken around them ? “ i actually think that was the plan , ” alex says . “ that we would travel to russia , and maybe they might go and meet people without us . but i don ’ t think there was a plan to tell us anything . ” tim agrees . if their parents had revealed the truth , it would have made tim and alex a huge liability ; “ as professionals ” , he says , it ’ s unlikely they would have taken the risk . they doubt their parents ever planned to tell them about their real identities . “ honestly , ” tim says , “ i really don ’ t think so . it sounds strange , but yeah . ” both brothers tell me they remember , as young children , seeing their grandparents . where ? on vacation , alex says , “ somewhere in europe ” ; he can ’ t remember where , exactly . asked if he was sure the people he met were his real grandparents , he says , “ i think so . ” were they speaking russian ? “ i was really young , i have no idea , ” he says firmly . i raise the question with tim , who would have been older . he remembers seeing his grandparents every few years until he was around 11 , when they disappeared from his life . “ obviously , now when i think back on it , i kind of understand how it worked . if i had seen them when i was older , i would have realised that they don ’ t speak english – they don ’ t seem very canadian . ” at christmas , the boys would receive gifts marked “ from grandparents ” . their parents told them they lived in alberta , far from toronto , which was why they never saw them . occasionally , new photographs would arrive of the grandparents against a snowy backdrop ; it helped that the climates of alberta and siberia are not so different . if tim and alex ’ s story sounds eerily familiar to fans of the americans , the television drama about a kgb couple living in the us with their two children , that ’ s because it ’ s partly based on them . the show is set in the 1980s , providing a cold war backdrop , but the 2010 spy round - up served as an inspiration . the show ’ s creator , joe weisberg , trained to be a cia case officer in the early 1990s and , when i speak to him on the phone , tells me he always wanted to put family at the heart of the plot . “ one of the interesting things i saw when i worked at the cia was people lying to their children . if you have young children , you can ’ t tell them you work for the cia . and then , at some point , you have to pick an age and a time , and they find out that they ’ ve been lied to for most of their lives . it ’ s a difficult moment . ” when i meet alex in moscow , he has just finished watching the first season . ( he had started on previous occasions , but found it too difficult ; he and tim joked that they should sue the creators . ) his parents like the show , he tells me . “ obviously it ’ s glamorised , all this killing people and action everywhere . but it reminded them of when they were young agents , and how they felt about being in a strange new place . ” watching it , alex says , has made him more curious : what set his parents off on this path , and why ? * * * in 2010 , the spies were welcomed back to russia as heroes . after a debriefing at svr headquarters , bezrukov , vavilova and the other deportees met with then - president dmitry medvedev to receive medals for their service . later , they met with putin , and the group reportedly sang the patriotic soviet song from where the motherland begins . the authorities put on a tour : the agents and their families travelled to st petersburg , lake baikal in siberia and sochi on the black sea . the idea was to show off modern russia , and to provide them with an opportunity to bond . do they still meet up , i ask alex . “ from time to time , ” he says . he and tim were the only adolescents ; of the four couples arrested , two had younger children , while another had adult sons . even so , the other families were probably the only people in the world who could even begin to understand their surreal situation . bezrukov and vavilova found themselves back in a very different russia from the one they had left . the oldest of the agents had been retired from active espionage work for a decade , alex says , and barely remembered how to speak russian . the group were told they would no longer work for the svr , but jobs were found for them in state banks and oil companies . anna chapman was given a television series and now has her own fashion line . bezrukov was given a job at mgimo , a prestigious moscow university , and has written a book on the geopolitical challenges facing russia . tim and alex were given russian passports at the end of december 2010 ; suddenly , they became timofei and alexander vavilov . the names were “ completely new , foreign and unpronounceable for us ” , tim says . “ a real identity crisis , ” he adds with a hint of bitterness . unable to return to university for his final year , he managed to transfer to a russian university and complete his degree there , before doing an mba in london . alex was less lucky . he finished high school at the british international school in moscow , but did not want to stay in russia . he applied to university in canada , but was told he would first have to apply for a new birth certificate , and then a citizenship certificate ; only then could he renew his canadian passport . in 2012 he was admitted to the university of toronto , and applied for a four - year student visa on his russian passport . the visa was issued and he planned to depart for canada on 2 september . but four days before he was due to leave , as he was packing his bags and exchanging emails with his future roommate , he received a phone call from the canadian embassy in moscow demanding he come for an urgent interview . the meeting was hostile ; there were a lot of questions about his life and his parents . the visa was annulled before his eyes , and he lost his university place . alex has since been rejected for french and british visas . twice , he has been accepted to study at the london school of economics , but both times did not get a visa . eventually , he was able to get a visa to study elsewhere in europe ; tim travels mainly in asia , where many countries can be visited visa - free on a russian passport . if tim and alex ’ s story sounds eerily familiar to fans of the americans , the television drama about a kgb couple living in the us with their two children , that ’ s because it ’ s partly based on them . the show is set in the 1980s , providing a cold war backdrop , but the 2010 spy round - up served as an inspiration . the show ’ s creator , joe weisberg , trained to be a cia case officer in the early 1990s and , when i speak to him on the phone , tells me he always wanted to put family at the heart of the plot . “ one of the interesting things i saw when i worked at the cia was people lying to their children . if you have young children , you can ’ t tell them you work for the cia . and then , at some point , you have to pick an age and a time , and they find out that they ’ ve been lied to for most of their lives . it ’ s a difficult moment . ” when i meet alex in moscow , he has just finished watching the first season .

* * * in 2010 , the spies were welcomed back to russia as heroes . after a debriefing at svr headquarters , bezrukov , vavilova and the other deportees met with then - president dmitry medvedev to receive medals for their service . later , they met with putin , and the group reportedly sang the patriotic soviet song from where the motherland begins . the authorities put on a tour : the agents and their families travelled to st petersburg , lake baikal in siberia and sochi on the black sea . the idea was to show off modern russia , and to provide them with an opportunity to bond . do they still meet up , i ask alex . “ from time to time , ” he says . he and tim were the only adolescents ; of the four couples arrested , two had younger children , while another had adult sons . even so , the other families were probably the only people in the world who could even begin to understand their surreal situation . bezrukov and vavilova found themselves back in a very different russia from the one they had left . the oldest of the agents had been retired from active espionage work for a decade , alex says , and barely remembered how to speak russian . the group were told they would no longer work for the svr , but jobs were found for them in state banks and oil companies . anna chapman was given a television series and now has her own fashion line . bezrukov was given a job at mgimo , a prestigious moscow university , and has written a book on the geopolitical challenges facing russia . tim and alex were given russian passports at the end of december 2010 ; suddenly , they became timofei and alexander vavilov . the names were “ completely new , foreign and unpronounceable for us ” , tim says . “ a real identity crisis , ” he adds with a hint of bitterness . unable to return to university for his final year , he managed to transfer to a russian university and complete his degree there , before doing an mba in london . alex was less lucky . he finished high school at the british international school in moscow , but did not want to stay in russia . he applied to university in canada , but was told he would first have to apply for a new birth certificate , and then a citizenship certificate ; only then could he renew his canadian passport . in 2012 he was admitted to the university of toronto , and applied for a four - year student visa on his russian passport . the visa was issued and he planned to depart for canada on 2 september . but four days before he was due to leave , as he was packing his bags and exchanging emails with his future roommate , he received a phone call from the canadian embassy in moscow demanding he come for an urgent interview . the meeting was hostile ; there were a lot of questions about his life and his parents . the visa was annulled before his eyes , and he lost his university place . alex has since been rejected for french and british visas . twice , he has been accepted to study at the london school of economics , but both times did not get a visa . eventually , he was able to get a visa to study elsewhere in europe ; tim travels mainly in asia , where many countries can be visited visa - free on a russian passport . the brothers ’ battle to regain canadian citizenship is not just about logistics . moscow is not a city that embraces newcomers , and neither of them feels particularly russian . “ i feel like i have been stripped of my own identity for something i had nothing to do with , ” alex tells me . both are keen to work in asia for the time being , but want to move to canada when they feel ready to start families . more than anything , their canadian identity is the last straw they have left to grasp on to , after so much of the rest of their previous reality fell away . “ i lived for 20 years believing that i was canadian and i still believe i am canadian , nothing can change that , ” tim wrote in his affidavit to the toronto court . “ i do not have any attachment to russia , i do not speak the language , i do not know many friends there , i have not lived there for any extended periods of time and i do not want to live there . ” everyone who is born in canada is eligible for canadian citizenship , with one exception : those who are born to employees of foreign governments . but the brothers ’ toronto - based lawyer , hadayt nazami , argues that it is ridiculous to apply the provision to their case ; the whole point of the law , he says , is to prevent those who don ’ t have the responsibilities of citizenship from enjoying its privileges . ultimately , the court seems to be operating as much on emotional as on legal grounds , possibly with the wall street journal story about tim ’ s apparent recruitment at the back of its mind . but even if the brothers knew about their parents ’ activities ( and there is no hard evidence of this ) , i wondered what the court expected of them . what is a 16 - year - old who finds out he is the child of russian spies supposed to do ? call the fbi ? tim and alex have been through many months of questioning themselves and their identities , and of wondering whether they should be angry with their parents . they don ’ t want their childhood to define them as they grow older . many of their close friends know , but most of their casual acquaintances don ’ t . when asked where they are from , the default response for both is “ canada ” . they remain friends with many people from their previous life in boston , though tim says some broke off contact , mainly those whose parents were friends with his parents and felt betrayed . while they have no wish to live in russia , both brothers visit moscow every few months to see their parents . i ask them how hard it has been to keep that relationship going . was there a confrontation ? tim and alex choose their words carefully ; they want to appear rational and pragmatic , rather than emotional , it seems . “ of course , there were some very difficult times , ” tim says . “ but if i get angry with them , it ’ s not going to lead to any beneficial outcomes . ” he admits it is sad that , even though he can now spend time with his grandparents , the language barrier means he will never know them properly . “ in terms of family and keeping this whole thing together , it really doesn ’ t work out well when you choose this kind of path , ” he says , his voice trailing off wistfully . alex tells me that he sometimes wonders why his parents decided to have children at all . “ they live their lives like everyone else , making choices along the way . i am glad they had a cause they believed in so strongly , but their choices mean i feel no connection to the country they risked their lives for . i wish the world wouldn ’ t punish me for their choices and actions . it has been deeply unjust . ” a number of times , alex tells me that it is not his place to judge his parents , but that six years ago he spent a long period wrestling with “ the big question ” of whether he hated them or felt betrayed . in the end , he came to one conclusion : that they were the same people who had raised him lovingly , whatever secrets they hid .

what does prince andrew find so attractive about foreign billionaires who own caribbean mansions ? with the jeffrey epstein scandal still casting its ugly shadow , the queen ' s second son may now face the fallout from a second deeply unedifying legal case involving one of his wealthy acquaintances . his name is peter nygard . he is a leathery 78 - year - old canadian fashion tycoon , famed for his ultra - flamboyant dress sense and the hedonistic lifestyle he has for years pursued at a ' private luxury resort ' he owns in the bahamas . called nygard cay , it is built on a 4 . 5 - acre patch of the island of new providence which he bought in 1987 and spent a decade turning into what he later described as a ' dream home ' , with 150 , 000 sq ft of mayan - themed buildings , stretching over a dozen ' cabana - style ' residences designed for holding lavish parties . peter nygard is a 78 - year - old canadian fashion tycoon , famed for his ultra - flamboyant dress sense and the hedonistic lifestyle he has for years pursued at a ' private luxury resort ' he owns in the bahamas . pictured : actress suelyn medeiros and peter nygard arrive at a fashion eventthe buildings include a casino , a disco hut ( with cameras beneath the dance floor , reportedly to shoot images of revellers from below ) , a glass ceiling weighing 45 tons and the world ' s largest sauna , a 6 , 000 sq ft a - frame lodge made from 2ft - thick canadian pine logs . in the grounds there is a helipad , fake volcanoes that belch dry ice , a flock of peacocks , stone cobras which hiss steam at sunset , 60ft towers festooned with hundreds of flaming torches ( lit nightly by staff ) , and giant statues of nude women , purportedly modelled on the owner ' s former girlfriends . andrew visited in early 2000 , around the time of his 40th birthday . by then he had been divorced for four years and , with his royal navy career drawing to a close , was in the first throes of a midlife crisis that would also see him pursue an ill - fated friendship with epstein , whose own private caribbean island — subsequently dubbed ' paedo island ' after disturbing revelations about the financier — he had visited the summer before . like epstein , nygard moved in colourful circles . the father of at least seven children by four women , he was at the time dating former playboy model anna nicole smith , and had for years entertained famous chums at nygard cay . his personal website boasts that guests ranged from pop royalty ( michael jackson , lenny kravitz ) to hollywood a - listers ( robert deniro , sylvester stallone , jessica alba , zoe saldana , sean connery ) to the former u . s . president george h . w . bush and several members of the kennedy clan . none of these high - profile chums , many of whom are pictured on nygard ' s website , seemed unduly bothered that their host had in recent years settled widely reported sexual harassment cases against three women who worked for his clothing company . andrew , who visited with ex - wife sarah ferguson and their two daughters , was also untroubled by that pressing fact . the 99 - page document says the well - connected tycoon ( pictured ) used his wealth and status to systematically ' groom and entice underage girls ' into a globetrotting haremnygard founded clothing producer nygard international and is known as an eccentric playboythe visit to nygard ' s home did not , of course , feature in the court circular . instead , details were disclosed by the billionaire in an interview with canada ' s national post newspaper shortly afterwards , when he waxed lyrical about how excited it had made his elderly mother , who was also in residence there . ' last week was a big week for her , ' he said . ' on monday , george bush came over to my house , and then on thursday , sarah ferguson and prince andrew came over . ' in fact , nygard recorded andrew ' s visit for posterity . a photograph shows them wandering together on the sand , with the prince wearing boat shoes and matching blue shorts and shirt . other royal guests of nygard over the years have included crown princess marie - chantal of greece and princess michael of kent , while he has also pursued a doubtless lucrative business relationship with cherie blair . all of which provides an intriguing , not to mention potentially explosive , backdrop to a truly extraordinary legal action that was launched in new york this week . on thursday , lawyers acting for ten unidentified women filed a class - action lawsuit claiming that nygard ' s bahamian mansion , where so many celebrities and a handful of royals partook of his hospitality , was a den of iniquity where countless underage girls were routinely abused . with the jeffrey epstein scandal still casting its ugly shadow , the queen ' s second son ( pictured alongside ex - wife sarah ferguson ) may now face the fallout from a second deeply unedifying legal case involving one of his wealthy acquaintancesthe 99 - page document says the well - connected tycoon used his wealth and status to systematically ' groom and entice underage girls ' into a globetrotting harem , where they would be paid cash and promised ' lucrative modelling opportunities ' , after which he would ' assault , rape and sodomise them ' . the allegations are all vigorously denied by nygard , whose spokesman derided them yesterday as ' completely false ' and ' without foundation ' , saying the tycoon ' looks forward to fully exposing this scam and once and for all clearing his name ' . but for their part , nygard ' s accusers , who are demanding a jury trial on multiple abuse and sex - trafficking charges , insist he would instruct employees to ' procure ' young girls , largely from poor neighbourhoods of new providence , to attend events at the mansion . he would then , the accusers say , take them to what he called ' pamper parties ' , where they were ' plied with drugs and alcohol ' , then violently assaulted . other alleged abuse occurred on yachts and at properties in nygard ' s portfolio of luxury residences , which stretches to florida , california and new york . in one of the cases , nygard is accused of showing a 14 - year - old girl vile ' pornography ' before raping her , ' causing extraordinary pain and trauma ' . she claims to have been paid cash from nygard ' s company funds in return . another accuser says she was 15 when nygard invited her to a bedroom in his bahamian mansion during a ' pamper party ' , ostensibly to smoke marijuana . she claims he ' asked her . . . ' to perform a depraved sex act . when she refused , she says he ' attempted to sodomise ' her and ' then raped her vaginally ' . several others allege they were drugged by nygard before being raped and assaulted . one 14 - year - old local claims he gave her three pills before raping her when she was unconscious . the next day he allegedly paid her $5 , 000 . the mansion includes an area on stilts that leads out over the sea . it is allegedly the scene of where nygard plied teenage girls with drink and drunks before raping themanother , who was 17 , says nygard made a drink that made her feel ' nauseated and very sleepy ' . she says she recalls nygard ' asking to urinate in her mouth ' but has no memory of what happened next . the lawsuit claims that when she woke up ' there was blood in the back of her underwear . . . nygard gave her $550 in u . s . currency and sent her away ' . it should be stressed that lawyers and a spokesman for nygard have described each and every charge in the lawsuit as false . his lawyer , jay prober , told newspapers in canada , where he currently resides , that the claims are ' vigorously denied ' . neither have any of the complainants , who are now aged between 18 and 36 , implicated any celebrity friends who visited nygard ' s bahamian home in the alleged abuse . i can reveal , however , that this isn ' t the only lawsuit prince andrew ' s billionaire acquaintance faces . last month , lawyers acting for two more women filed separate lawsuits against him at the superior court of california , in los angeles . one , maridel carbuccia , claims in a 32 - page document that she was repeatedly abused , sexually harassed , groped and on one occasion drugged and sexually assaulted during almost three years in his employment . this lawsuit claims that carbuccia , who was married with a young son , moved to los angeles in late 2015 after landing a job helping to run a medical cannabis farm that nygard was setting up on a 50 , 000 sq ft site in the hills above malibu . trouble began shortly afterwards , it claims , when the billionaire ' unexpectedly grabbed her buttocks ' , leaving her ' shocked and upset ' . then , in april 2016 , she says he turned up to a one - on - one meeting at the los angeles mansion ' completely naked ' and again propositioned her . the mayan - style property boasts 12 cabanas , an aquarium , helipad and casinonygard has lived on the islands since 1987 , and owns a mayan - themed mansion compoundlater that day , the lawsuit further alleges , he ' gave a drink which she consumed ' , only to rapidly begin to pass out . as she was losing consciousness , she claims , her employer ' led her to his bedroom ' . the next day ' when she awoke , she saw her own blood on her skin and clothes and it was apparent that while she was unconscious , nygard had sexually assaulted her ' . at one point , the lawsuit alleges , nygard decided that her professional duties should also include acting as his ' house manager ' . this role , she claims , included inviting large numbers of women , including prostitutes , to attend ' pamper parties ' where he would ' get a good look at them and select those whom he would pay for sex ' . carbuccia eventually left his employment in august 2018 . she is now suing for damages on nine separate grounds , including battery , sexual battery , breach of contract , fraud and unpaid wages , and has demanded a jury trial . her attorney is gloria allred , a famed hollywood lawyer whose recent work has included representing victims of jeffrey epstein . nygard has yet to submit a formal response . his attorney did not respond to requests to comment on this particular case . the second woman , known only as ' jane doe ' , is a resident of houston in texas . in nine - page complaint , she has alleged that nygard ' repeatedly had sexual intercourse with her at his home ' in los angeles in october 2012 , when he was 71 and she was ' a minor under 18 years old ' ( california ' s age of consent ) . ' nygard was fully aware of [her] age , yet repeatedly had sexual intercourse with her at his home . nygard did not allow [her] to leave his residence without his permission , ' the document claims . the lawsuit further alleges that , in the ensuing weeks , nygard trafficked her to china and new york on his private jet . ' while in new york , nygard invited [her] to a " club " without informing her of the full nature of the club . nygard took [her] to a " swingers club " and instructed her to have sex with an individual so nygard could trade and have sex with the individual ' s partner , ' it claims . he then supposedly took her to fort lauderdale in florida ' and continued to have sex with [her] while she was a minor ' . ' jane doe ' is suing for damages on nine counts , including battery , sexual battery , assault , false imprisonment , harassment , and intentional infliction of emotional distress . her lawyers are also demanding a jury trial . again , nygard has yet to submit a formal response and , like any defendant in a case that has yet to be tested in court , should be considered innocent until proven otherwise . the businessman , who grew up in relative poverty , certainly has a compelling rags - to - riches story . his empire controls several of canada ' s most successful womenswear brands and he travels in a private jet that has ' peter nygard n - force ' painted on the outside and reportedly features a stripper ' s pole inside . however , claims of impropriety ( always vehemently denied and never proven ) have frequently interrupted his trajectory . in 1980 , he was charged with raping an 18 - year - old girl , only for charges to be dropped after she suddenly decided not to testify . he later alleged that the police had shown ' poor judgment ' in investigating the case . in the 1990s , three separate women who worked in his office filed sexual harassment complaints with the manitoba human rights commission , which he settled . one , a 27 - year - old travel co - ordinator , claimed she ' repeatedly brushed off mr nygard ' s touches and sexual advances ' in the workplace . another , a 39 - year - old communications manager , said that , when called into nygard ' s office , she would ' find him in a state of undress ( pants open , no shirt ) or with his hands down the front of his pants , fondling himself ' . she also claimed he once added ' naked swimming ' to the agenda of a business meeting and that , in the bahamas , ' frequently was grabbing himself ( wearing a very small bathing suit ) ' . at the time , mr nygard ' s lawyer claimed the women filed complaints in order to get better severance payments from the firm , saying it settled to avoid litigation costs . he also faced a sexual harassment suit in 1996 from a los angeles employee who claimed that , against her wishes , ' she spent the night in peter nygard ' s bed and engaged in sexual intercourse with him ' . she later rejected his advances , she claims , and was eventually fired . this case was later dismissed . again , it is worth noting that none of the above incidents appear to have prevented prince andrew bringing his two daughters and ex - wife on that 2000 visit to nygard cay . in 2008 , another woman — a former girlfriend — filed a lawsuit against nygard in los angeles superior court , alleging that he had slammed a bedroom door shut on her hand . again , the case was settled and nygard denies any wrongdoing . then , in 2010 , the canadian broadcasting corporation put out a panorama - style documentary about nygard , focusing on alleged sex abuse and harassment of former employees . it quoted a former stewardess on his private plane who alleged that on one journey — during which nygard was accompanied by a troupe of topless women — he lost his temper with staff , shouting : ' you are nothing ! you are garbage ! i am god ! ' the programme also alleged that nygard had engaged in ' inappropriate sexual contact ' with a young woman who had been brought to his home in 2003 from the dominican republic . nygard vehemently denied that either incident had happened , and sued to stop the documentary being broadcast . when that failed , he filed a criminal complaint against the journalists who made it before suing cbc for defamation . eight years later , that case is still wending its way through the canadian court system . but perhaps the most high - profile , and certainly the most bizarre legal tussle to involve nygard , is a dispute with his next - door neighbour in the bahamas , a new york hedge fund boss called louis bacon . this started in the mid - noughties as a somewhat petty dispute over car parking on an access road to their properties , along with noise from nygard ' s late - night parties , but has snowballed into an avalanche of litigation which has seen at least 18 lawsuits filed in the u . s . , canada and the caribbean . in 2016 , cherie blair — who rarely seems to meet a foreign billionaire she won ' t take paid work from — played a curious cameo in their battle . the wall street journal revealed that her law firm , omnia , had been hired to try to dig up dirt on bacon . she proceeded to contact a british former employee of bacon ' s hedge fund called julian rifat , who had been jailed for insider dealing , with a view to persuading him to tell the u . s . authorities about alleged wrongdoing at bacon ' s firm . after several meetings , the plan seems to have been abandoned . hostilities between nygard and bacon reached a peak , of sorts , last january when a court in the bahamas issued a warrant for nygard ' s arrest on contempt of court charges related to a case involving claims that nygard illegally dredged sand from the sea floor to enlarge the size of his private beach . he has been unable to visit the bahamas since , and in november was sentenced to jail time in absentia . a spokesman branded that decision ' unfair , unreasonable and unnecessary ' and vowed to appeal . in new york , meanwhile , lawyers for nygard recently filed a lawsuit claiming bacon was attempting to ' bring down ' their client by persuading various women to provide the new york times with ' false information ' regarding his conduct towards them . this is the only nygard lawsuit against bacon that has not been struck out or withdrawn . yesterday , nygard ' s attorneys were once more blaming bacon for their woes , claiming that the latest ugly lawsuit stemmed from their seemingly endless battle and is ' just the latest in a ten - plus - year string of attempts to try to destroy the reputation of a man through false statements ' . doubtless the american courts will eventually decide whether that claim holds merit . in the meantime , prince andrew , cherie blair and every celebrity who partied at the billionaire ' s lavish mansion will surely be watching with bated breath . 
__label__no_relevant jets snapshots : maurice can relate to the painful experience of nhl coaches getting fired another week , another big - name nhl coach gets fired . this time it was a shocker as the vegas golden knights brought down the axe on gerard gallant , who led them to the stanley cup final in 2018 as an expansion team . with the knights on the bubble to make the playoffs this season , gallant was shown the door and was replaced by former sharks coach pete deboer , who was fired by san jose in mid - december . among the other head coaches who have been fired this year are peter laviolette ( nashville ) and mike babcock ( toronto ) , who have both taken teams to the stanley cup final . in total , six nhl coaches have been fired this season — including jim montgomery in dallas and john hynes in new jersey —and another , bill peters in calgary , resigned . winnipeg jets head coach paul maurice has been fired a few times during his 25 - year nhl career , and he ’ s sure a lot of his colleagues have been going through painful times . “ it ’ s a very painful experience , ” maurice said . “ it ’ s a very personal , yet very public , experience . “ i think this is the best analogy : you ’ re in a marriage , you love the woman but it ’ s getting a little bit rocky . then you come home one day and she says ‘paul , we ’ re going in a different direction and there ’ s gonna be a press conference in three hours and we ’ re gonna talk about how great the new husband ’ s gonna be . ’ “ so , it ’ s tough . you put your heart and soul into it and then you ’ re out . ” maurice and jon cooper of the tampa bay lightning , who will play in winnipeg on friday night , are the two longest tenured coaches in the nhl . maurice is in his fifth season , cooper his eighth . “ stay low , ” maurice joked , when asked how they manage it . “ it ’ s a lonely experience and it ’ s not easy getting fired . you ’ re passionately committed to your team and this is not a part - time job and it ’ s not casual . you lose , you think about that right until the puck drops the next game . you ’ re all in it , completely committed to it and it goes from 100 miles an hour down to zero , like that . “ what makes it easier is , if you ’ ve got some experience and you ’ ve done some quality work , you ’ re probably gonna get another chance . ” to that end , deboer , who is one of maurice ’ s best friends , was out of work for less than a month , “ when pete got fired i wasn ’ t sad for him because i knew he was gonna be back , ” maurice said . “ i didn ’ t know it was gonna be 30 days . i thought he might get to enjoy the entire month of january . “ but he ’ s gonna be ok . he has coached a long time in the nhl . ” entering play thursday , the jets were tied with the golden knights for the final western conference wild - card playoff spot with 54 points , but had two games in hand . no goal for bitettothe last time anthony bitetto scored an nhl goal was nov . 18 , 2017 , so you can imagine how excited he was when he saw his shot go in on tuesday against the vancouver canucks . “ i feel like most people , when they score a goal in the nhl , they ’ re gonna be happy , ” bitetto said . “ it ’ s not like i score many of them , so when it goes in , obviously i ’ m gonna be happy . ” unfortunately , the canucks challenged for offside and the goal was overturned , taking away bitetto ’ s first of the season . the same thing happened to defenceman carl dahlstrom earlier this season . “ it ’ s unfortunate but it was offside and they made the right call , ” bitetto said . “ you ’ ve just got to live with it and i don ’ t think there ’ s any more to it . it ’ s a bummer , but we had a lot of time left in that game and we had to re - focus that . ” bitetto ’ s goal would have given the jets a 2 - 0 lead , but they didn ’ t let the off - side ruling deter them , as they went on to win 4 - 0 . more changes on blue - linedespite having a huge amount of upheaval on their blue - line , the jets enter friday ’ s game sitting 13th in the nhl in goals against per game . a great deal of that is owed to the play of goaltender connor hellebuyck , but the patchwork defence is doing a better job than most people would have expected it could . off - season departures , dustin byfuglien ’ s suspension , and injuries have forced the jets to use nine different defencemen this season , with the pairings changing on a regular basis . for friday ’ s game , dmitry kulikov will return from the flu and play with josh morrissey , while neal pionk will play alongside sami niku and bitetto will play with luca sbisa . dahlstrom has been diagnosed with a broken bone in his hand and will be out six weeks . “ the biggest thing is we all practice together and we rotate , especially when there ’ s seven of us out there , ” bitetto said . “ we all play with each other at different times . “ the biggest thing is try to find something that guy does and stick with it , so we keep it simple . i ’ ve played with ( sbisa ) before and it doesn ’ t matter who you are playing with , just play hard . ” while many people point to the jets defence group as the reason the team has given up the most shots in the league , maurice is continually impressed with their work . “ it ’ s kind of their ability to get off the mat and compete every game , ” maurice said . “ we have a really unique group back there right now and every one of them has found a way to do what they do really well as their no . 1 thing . ” nathan beaulieu and tucker poolman , who have been regulars this season , are both currently injured , so guys such as niku , sbisa and bitetto are getting regular turns . poolman has been placed on injured reserve , so it ’ s likely the jets will recall a defenceman from the manitoba moose of the ahl before they embark on a three - game road trip to chicago , carolina and columbus this weekend . “ there ’ s been some difficulties , just with changeover of partners and handedness , perhaps , but all in all i think we ’ ve handled it pretty well , ” morrissey said after practice at bell mts place on thursday . “ we have a great group of guys , we all get along and we all want to help each other . “ there are some difficulties to it for sure but we ’ ve really had the mentality that no matter who ’ s out there or who you are with , the other team doesn ’ t care . at the end of the day , you ’ ve got to make plays , make defensive plays and get the job done . “ that ’ s been our m . o . this year . you can listen to the white noise or the critics or whatever you want but at the end of the day , when you ’ re out there , there ’ s nothing you can do but make the play and play as hard as you can . i think we ’ ve been doing a pretty good job of it . ” twyman@postmedia . comtwitter . com / ted_wyman

" this is the most severe period of repression that we have seen in decades in china , " said kenneth roth , hrw executive director . in its world report 2020 , launched tuesday at the united nations , the rights group chronicles abuses in 95 countries . it expresses its deepest concern , though , about an emboldened china , which it warns is using its growing global economic influence to silence domestic critics and deter condemnation abroad . file - kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watchat home , hrw says president xi jinping ' s government uses a combination of technology and intimidation to keep its people in line . most concerning is the government ' s treatment of millions of ethnic uigher muslims . " for the uighers and other turkic muslims of xinjiang , beijing has built the most intrusive system of surveillance we have ever seen and coupled it with the largest case of mass arbitrary detention in decades , " roth told reporters . in the northwest territory of xinjiang , where most uigher ' s live , communist party officials and loyalists " visit " and live in homes of some uighers to monitor them . the government also has harnessed technology to deploy facial - recognition systems and use the forced collection of dna samples , as well as phone apps , to collect their data . a million or more uighers are incarcerated in " re - education " facilities , separated from their families , with many children being left without their parents . china has defended its treatment of the uighers , saying they are in vocational training and that it is pursuing de - radicalization and counterterror efforts . roth urged countries to deny beijing the international respectability it desires , saying that can help force positive change . " governments should deliberately counter china ' s divide - and - conquer strategy for securing silence about its repression , " roth said .

__label__no_relevant camera traps and customary wisdom help redefine bear conservation camera traps set up around a canadian artic research camp led to the first published documentation of all three north american bear species in the same locations . although more than 90 percent of the 401 bear visits recorded by the cameras were of polar bears , the presence of grizzlies , which have been seen as threatening polar bears , has caused debate among scientists , conservation managers and local communities . the camera data did not document interactions among polar , grizzly and black bears , though the researchers say the spatial overlap of the species suggests potential for interspecies interactions to occur , raising questions about how they might affect bear conservation efforts in the future . some conservation managers , aware that their values align with those of the region ’ s indigenous communities , are increasingly marrying traditional wisdom to scientific methods to inform their work . in 1998 , douglas clark witnessed manitoba ’ s second recorded grizzly bear ( ursus arctos horribilis ) sighting of the century . then a warden in canada ’ s wapusk national park , he remembers swooping down near the shores of hudson bay in a bell 212 helicopter to confirm the distinctive , muscular hump of a lone grizzly running along a gravel beach ridge . grizzlies had been considered extirpated in this sliver of the province since the late 1800s , and wapusk — literally meaning “ white bear ” in cree — was a land ruled by the polar bear ( ursus maritimus ) , an apex predator that was protected at all costs . “ get down there with a trap and a rifle and get rid of that thing ! ” he recalls a senior park manager telling him . grizzly sightings on this polar bear turf by researchers and locals increased over the next two decades . the lethal control approach has been touted by some conservation communities , with fears that grizzly bear range expansion would threaten polar bear populations . now , with recently captured camera trap footage showing grizzlies , polar bears and black bears ( ursus americanus ) roaming the park in close proximity , clark said he suspected his latest research may shift the conservation status quo in canada ’ s ever - changing north . “ many conservationists don ’ t look positively on the idea of environmental changes , especially when it affects high - profile species , like the polar bear , ” clark told mongabay . “ grizzlies are the new kids on the block … so , it poses the question , is this change good or bad ? and are we valuing polar bears more than grizzlies ? ” a study led by clark , published in arctic science , is the result of a chance encounter in 2011 , when he returned to wapusk as a conservation scientist with the university of saskatchewan . rigging a set of reconyx heat - and motion - activated camera traps to the outposts of his research camp , clark aimed to gather data for his studies on human - polar bear interactions . however , one year in , while sifting through images triggered by park staff on snowmobiles , wandering birds and the occasional polar bear , he noticed an unexpected face wander across the frame : the first on - camera documentation of a grizzly in northern manitoba . cameras corroborate species overlapshortly afterward , his team ’ s camera traps were picking up visits from black bears as well . although neither species was entirely new to the area , these snapshots were the first tangible evidence that polar bears weren ’ t the only carnivores to roam these lands , or perhaps , to even call them home . “ it is and it isn ’ t surprising … trappers have known about this for years , ” clark said . “ but having these cameras out over time , we were able to show that it was more than one bear of all of the species and that it ’ s repeated . it ’ s not just one random bear wandering through . ” set at 85 centimeters ( 2 . 8 feet ) high , the cameras could not distinguish individual bears but used an infrared flash to count bear visits to a given camera by an individual or family of bears within a one - hour period . in six years of recording , the cameras have successfully captured 401 polar , grizzly and black bear visits at three camps within the park . more than 90 percent of these visits were by polar bears . the trap setup consists of four cameras facing each of the cardinal directions around the perimeter of each camp , and one additional camera for redundancy . the team lucked into a trap arrangement — in terms of height , location and distance apart — that could adequately capture the trio of species , and so its positioning has remained essentially untouched to this day . although no interspecies interactions have emerged , one set of photos captured a polar bear and a black bear passing by the same camera some three hours apart from one another . it ’ s likely , clark says , that this narrow time frame indicates these bears were aware of each other and could quite possibly be adapting to the other ’ s presence . other footage has prompted the team to suspect that some grizzly bears are even denning in the area and not just passing through . “ suddenly , this takes us into the terrain of values , ” clark said , “ and it forces us to really take a hard look at bear and park conservation in an area where a bunch of ecosystems converge , and in a time where all of these ecosystems are changing very rapidly as a result of climate change . ” combining cameras and culturehow best to approach this influx of non - native predators is a question that remains unanswered . the common approach to conservation , within national parks especially , is to preserve an environment in its known state . but as much of canada ’ s subarctic regions rapidly thaw and evolve , this approach becomes less realistic and more difficult to achieve . to ensure a thoughtful approach , clark says , undoubtedly involves the local people , who harbor a deep knowledge of the land and the ecological changes it ’ s undergone . however , many residents of northern manitoba are at odds with the initiatives of polar bear conservationists and researchers , as local perspectives have historically been cast aside or , in some cases , ignored entirely . for example , researchers have fitted bears with tracking tags to understand their movements , but many communities consider the tags an interference with local hunting traditions and insulting to the bears who , in some cultural views , are considered to be non - human persons . “ the politics of polar bear conservation has been going bad for about 14 years . conservation - wise , policy - wise , wildlife management - wise , it ’ s a train wreck , ” clark said . northern canada has been the epicenter of debates surrounding these matters , often between researchers and media , who put polar bears on an ecological pedestal , and indigenous peoples for whom polar bears are a primary resource . chris darimont is an interdisciplinary conservation scientist with the university of victoria and the raincoast conservation foundation who has conducted much of his research in partnership with indigenous governments along canada ’ s west coast . darimont promotes the fusion of scientific methods with traditional wisdom and management strategies . “ management intervention that isn ’ t carefully considered has a track record of making things worse , ” darimont told mongabay . indigenous communities , he said , had managed natural resources for thousands of years in a way that was inherently sustainable and woven into their culture . government agencies , lacking that kind of relationship and working with limited knowledge , are “ more likely to commodify resources , ” darimont said . generally , in darimont ’ s experience , indigenous governments on the west coast have values that align with those of area conservationists . “ we find that [indigenous knowledge and science] are frequently complementary . they often tell the same story , perhaps in slightly different ways , ” he said . “ but indigenous knowledge might , for example , provide things that science cannot , and vice versa . ” a study co - authored by darimont and fellow researchers in 2014 successfully combined these two schools of knowledge . noticing an increase in grizzly bear sightings throughout the archipelago off british columbia , his team deployed camera traps and non - invasive hair - snagging sites to track bear movements and genetics . “ we combined our photographs and genetic detections with interview data from elderly knowledge holders in two [first nations] communities on the coast , ” darimont said . “ what that did is give us data that our western science data could never do , and that is , go back in time . what we couldn ’ t do is put remote cameras on these islands 60 years ago , so each knowledge source provided something the other knowledge source couldn ’ t … it was a pretty powerful story . ” clark , too , said he hoped to further marry camera trap data collection with the expertise of local people in northern communities . “ you can combine the robustness of the cameras with the ingenuity and knowledge that the local people have about the land that they live on , ” he said . “ this also gives them a way to gain a voice and some real traction in these debates about bear conservation that really do affect them a great deal . ” in his next phase of bear conservation research , clark plans to arm communities in northern manitoba and nunavut with camera traps of their own . his off - the - shelf reconyx suite has provided a reliable view of the changing landscape . so far , however , he ’ s been able to capture only snapshots within the cameras ’ 25 - meter ( 82 - foot ) sensor range , and his curiosity of what lies beyond camp perimeters has prompted him to continue documenting the tale of the three bears in wapusk national park . clark said he thinks the information gained in wapusk can help the conservation community around the world grapple with parallel situations . “ preserving a steady - state environment in the subarctic on the coast of hudson bay , or probably pretty much anywhere , is no longer an option , ” he said . “ these doctrines and these assumptions in orthodox conservation thinking are really powerful , very deep - seated and hard to dislodge . yet , the world is now forcing us dislodge them if we ’ re going to be able to do anything effective on the conservation front , now and in the future . ” citationclark , d . a . , brook , r . , oliphant -

" when you come forward , you ' re 10 times more likely to be killed , " bohemier , 49 , told cbc news in an interview . " especially when he ' s as violent as he is . i ' m terrified . " state police say bohemier is a victim of domestic violence , and officers have placed her in a secure location so her husband can ' t find and hurt her . she decided to tell her story to encourage other women to come forward and seek help if they are being abused . in 2018 , bohemier began corresponding with john paul gaddy , 31 , after she saw his profile on the website writeaprisoner . com . at the time , gaddy was serving a nine - year sentence for manslaughter and arson after he beat a man to death with a crowbar in 2010 , then set the victim ' s home on fire . bohemier decided to establish a pen - pal relationship with gaddy . " we wrote back and forth for over a year , " she said . " i trusted him . " she said gaddy told her about all the prison courses he had taken aimed at rehabilitation . she thought he was no longer the angry young man who had killed someone . " i truly believe people can change , " she said . in hindsight , she admitted she chose to ignore or explain away the red flags that might have stopped her from leaving her life in edmonton for what she thought would be a romantic new adventure . " he promised me the world , " said bohemier , who has a university degree in business management and accounting . " he would take care of me . he loved me . i was everything to him . and i believed him . " last september , the mother of five , whose children are mostly grown , quit her job in edmonton as a gravel truck driver and drove down to the united states on a six - month visitor visa . when gaddy was released on parole on sept . 2 , 2019 , she was at the avery - mitchell correctional institution in spruce pine , n . c . , to pick him up . " i thought he had changed , " said bohemier , who admitted she sometimes likes to take chances . the first attack happened in october , she said , when he put his hands around her neck . she went to the hospital because she had neck pain , blurry vision , a headache and was unable to hear out of one ear . but she didn ' t tell the doctor the truth about her injuries . in a medical record provided to cbc news , a doctor wrote of bohemier : " reports that last night she was in a bar in downtown charlotte when she was assaulted when she went to the bathroom . " the doctor said bohemier told him a woman had tried to strangle her and she was punched in the head and had her head slammed against a wall . she was given pain medication and written advice about domestic violence . two weeks later , on nov . 2 , 2019 , gaddy beat her unconscious with a blow to the head while they were in a car , she said . " from what i remember , we were having a disagreement about something and he just snapped . he said he was going to kill me . " john paul gaddy with kay bohemier in november 2019 . not long after he got out of prison . ( supplied by kay bohemier ) though she was covered in blood , gaddy drove to a gas station to fill up the car . while he was out of the car , bohemier took a photo of herself . gaddy was unnerved when he got back in the driver ' s seat because he thought someone had spotted the blood and was going to call 911 . he wanted to rush back home . she wanted to go to the hospital . " and he said no , we can ' t take you to the hospital , " bohemier recalled . " i ' ve got to take you home and clean up the blood because i ' ll be arrested if they see you like this . " police went to their house to check on her welfare . gaddy was nearby , listening . " i was terrified , " she said . " i lied actually and said i got jumped at the gas station . i didn ' t tell them it was him . " bohemier felt like it was easier to lie to the police than to risk gaddy ' s wrath . " the thing that went in my mind was if i tell them , he ' s going to kill me eventually . so i hid it . " bohemier remembered what gaddy had told her during an argument she secretly recorded , after she suggested she was going to call 911 . she provided the recording to cbc news . " don ' t call 911 , because i ' ll kill you and i ' ll kill my - goddamn - self , " gaddy yelled on the tape . " we ' ll look just like somebody on abc news . " ' you know i ' d never hurt you for real ' the abuse continued . bohemier said she packed her bags and tried to leave many times . one time , she said , gaddy tried to strangle her . with her suitcase open on the floor , she again secretly recorded their argument by placing her phone in her bra . kay bohemier shows injuries she suffered in the november 2019 assault . ( kay bohemier ) gaddy clearly sounded agitated when bohemier screamed at him , " you put your hands on me . you grabbed me . " soon there was the sound of her being hit and yelling in pain . she begged him to stop . gaddy tried to calm her down for more than 10 minutes as she cried and hyperventilated . " you know i ' d never hurt you for real , " he said . " i know in my mind not to hurt somebody i love . i ain ' t that stupid . " he apologized and told her he loved her . " i love you , too , " she responded . an expert on domestic violence said studies have shown a victim can leave her partner between seven and 20 times before fleeing for good . " it ' s definitely not the same for each woman and their circumstances are very different , " said esther elder with calgary - based women ' s shelter discovery house . kay bohemier ' s suitcase waiting to be packed as she secretly recorded an argument with john gaddy . ( kay bohemier ) " the cycle of violence often begins with a honeymoon period , when the perpetrator is very charming and very caring , which is then followed by increased coercive control that limits the victim ' s ability to act . that builds to violence , followed by a renewed and shortened honeymoon period . " bohemier said she began to feel like a hostage . " he kept me in the house and wouldn ' t allow me to leave , " she said . " he ' s taken my cellphone , my car keys . i ' m lucky i ' m alive . " she married gaddy in february . " i was in it for the long haul , " she said . " i was determined to make it work .

" monday was a holiday , " bohemier said . " they had to release him . they can ' t keep him 48 hours without seeing a judge . so they released him on bond . " police found a safe place for her to stay . a judge issued a one - week restraining order . gaddy remains free on probation from his 2010 manslaughter conviction and wears an electronic monitor . bohemier can ' t understand why he hasn ' t been taken back into custody , given the new charges he now faces . elder said bohemier ' s situation is dangerous . " she has a right to feel the way that she is feeling , " she said . " when a woman initially leaves , she is at the greatest risk of homicide . " mother ' s day card john gaddy gave to kay bohemier in may 2020 . she left him five days later . ( supplied by kay bohemier ) in canada , a woman is killed every six days by a current or former intimate partner . elder said during the pandemic , domestic violence has increased in both severity and frequency . bohemier wants to return to canada , but has no money and no source of income . a canadian friend has started a gofundme campaign on her behalf . crossing the border will be more complicated because of the pandemic . " i ' ve contacted the canadian embassy to find out if they ' ll let me back , " bohemier said . " i ' ve got to come armed with all the police reports , my medical records and everything when i get to the borders .

medical reasons , ” according to the ontario human rights commission . although it can cause chronic health problems and trauma , the procedure is used “ to control female sexuality , ensure chastity until marriage and to render young women more desirable for marriage purposes , ” the rights commission said on its website . the practice has been illegal in canada since 1997 . there has never been a successful prosecution in this country but in the u . s . , six people have been arrested since april for allegedly performing genital mutilations at a detroit clinic . in australia last year , a former midwife , kubra magennis , 72 , was convicted of performing genital mutilations on two girls , ages 6 and 11 . their mother was also found guilty as well as a religious cleric . story continues below advertisement “ practitioners of female genital mutilation are almost certainly entering canada to engage in female genital mutilation on both girls and women of primarily african and south -
