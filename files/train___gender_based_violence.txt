__label__relevant 629 pakistani girls sold as brides to china lahore , pakistan - - page after page , the names stack up : 629 girls and women from across pakistan who were sold as brides to chinese men and taken to china . the list , obtained by the associated press , was compiled by pakistani investigators determined to break up trafficking networks exploiting the country ' s poor and vulnerable . the list gives the most concrete figure yet for the number of women caught up in the trafficking schemes since 2018 . but since the time it was put together in june , investigators ' aggressive drive against the networks has largely ground to a halt . officials with knowledge of the investigations say that is because of pressure from government officials fearful of hurting pakistan ' s lucrative ties to beijing . the biggest case against traffickers has fallen apart . in october , a court in faisalabad acquitted 31 chinese nationals charged in connection with trafficking . several of the women who had initially been interviewed by police refused to testify because they were either threatened or bribed into silence , according to a court official and a police investigator familiar with the case . the two spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution for speaking out . at the same time , the government has sought to curtail investigations , putting " immense pressure " on officials from the federal investigation agency pursuing trafficking networks , said saleem iqbal , a christian activist who has helped parents rescue several young girls from china and prevented others from being sent there . " some ( fia officials ) were even transferred , " iqbal said in an interview . " when we talk to pakistani rulers , they don ' t pay any attention . " asked about the complaints , pakistan ' s interior and foreign ministries refused to comment . several senior officials familiar with the events said investigations into trafficking have slowed , the investigators are frustrated , and pakistani media have been pushed to curb their reporting on trafficking . the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals . " no one is doing anything to help these girls , " one of the officials said . " the whole racket is continuing , and it is growing . why ? because they know they can get away with it . the authorities won ' t follow through , everyone is being pressured to not investigate . trafficking is increasing now . " he said he was speaking out " because i have to live with myself . where is our humanity ? " china ' s foreign ministry said it was unaware of the list . " the two governments of china and pakistan support the formation of happy families between their people on a voluntary basis in keeping with laws and regulations , while at the same time having zero tolerance for and resolutely fighting against any person engaging in illegal cross - border marriage behaviour , " the ministry said in a statement faxed monday to ap ' s beijing bureau . an ap investigation earlier this year revealed how pakistan ' s christian minority has become a new target of brokers who pay impoverished parents to marry off their daughters , some of them teenagers , to chinese husbands who return with them to their homeland . many of the brides are then isolated and abused or forced into prostitution in china , often contacting home and pleading to be brought back . the ap spoke to police and court officials and more than a dozen brides - - some of whom made it back to pakistan , others who remained trapped in china - - as well as remorseful parents , neighbours , relatives and human rights workers . christians are targeted because they are one of the poorest communities in muslim - majority pakistan . the trafficking rings are made up of chinese and pakistani middlemen and include christian ministers , mostly from small evangelical churches , who get bribes to urge their flock to sell their daughters . investigators have also turned up at least one muslim cleric running a marriage bureau from his madrassa , or religious school . investigators put together the list of 629 women from pakistan ' s integrated border management system , which digitally records travel documents at the country ' s airports . the information includes the brides ' national identity numbers , their chinese husbands ' names and the dates of their marriages . all but a handful of the marriages took place in 2018 and up to april 2019 . one of the senior officials said it was believed all 629 were sold to grooms by their families . it is not known how many more women and girls were trafficked since the list was put together . but the official said , " the lucrative trade continues . " he spoke to the ap in an interview conducted hundreds of kilometres from his place of work to protect his identity . " the chinese and pakistani brokers make between 4 million and 10 million rupees ( $25 , 000 and $65 , 000 ) from the groom , but only about 200 , 000 rupees ( $1 , 500 ) , is given to the family , " he said . the official , with years of experience studying human trafficking in pakistan , said many of the women who spoke to investigators told of forced fertility treatments , physical and sexual abuse and , in some cases , forced prostitution . although no evidence has emerged , at least one investigation report contains allegations of organs being harvested from some of the women sent to china . in september , pakistan ' s investigation agency sent a report it labeled " fake chinese marriages cases " to prime minister imran khan . the report , a copy of which was attained by the ap , provided details of cases registered against 52 chinese nationals and 20 of their pakistani associates in two cities in eastern punjab province - - faisalabad , lahore - - as well as in the capital islamabad . the chinese suspects included the 31 later acquitted in court . the report said police discovered two illegal marriage bureaus in lahore , including one operated from an islamic centre and madrassa - - the first known report of poor muslims also being targeted by brokers . the muslim cleric involved fled police . after the acquittals , there are other cases before the courts involving arrested pakistani and at least another 21 chinese suspects , according to the report sent to the prime minister in september . but the chinese defendants in the cases were all granted bail and left the country , say activists and a court official . activists and human rights workers say pakistan has sought to keep the trafficking of brides quiet so as not to jeopardize pakistan ' s increasingly close economic relationship with china . china has been a steadfast ally of pakistan for decades , particularly in its testy relationship with india . china has provided islamabad with military assistance , including pre - tested nuclear devices and nuclear - capable missiles . today , pakistan is receiving massive aid under china ' s belt and road initiative , a global endeavour aimed at reconstituting the silk road and linking china to all corners of asia . under the $75 billion china - pakistan economic corridor project , beijing has promised islamabad a sprawling package of infrastructure development , from road construction and power plants to agriculture . the demand for foreign brides in china is rooted in that country ' s population , where there are roughly 34 million more men than women - - a result of the one - child policy that ended in 2015 after 35 years , along with an overwhelming preference for boys that led to abortions of girl children and female infanticide . a report released this month by human rights watch , documenting trafficking in brides from myanmar to china , said the practice is spreading . it said pakistan , cambodia , indonesia , laos , myanmar , nepal , north korea and vietnam have " all have become source countries for a brutal business . " " one of the things that is very striking about this issue is how fast the list is growing of countries that are known to be source countries in the bride trafficking business , " heather barr , the hrw report ' s author , told ap . omar warriach , amnesty international ' s campaigns director for south asia , said pakistan " must not let its close relationship with china become a reason to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses against its own citizens " - - either in abuses of women sold as brides or separation of pakistani women from husbands from china ' s muslim uighur population sent to " re - education camps " to turn them away from islam . " it is horrifying that women are being treated this way without any concern being shown by the authorities in either country . and it ' s shocking that it ' s happening on this scale , " he said . - - - - - - associated press writers munir ahmed and shahid aslam in islamabad contributed to this report .

grandchildren . but the road between then and now hasn ’ t been easy . story continues below advertisementjoyce says they tried counselling but fossella wasn ’ t ready for it . ultimately , she told him that he needed to truly commit to changing . “ you have to help yourself , ” she told him . “ i ’ m not going to even help you this time . ” it was always her trying to save their marriage , joyce remembers . “ i was always the one looking and seeking help . ” it took joyce fossella two years to feel safe around her husband after he tried to kill her . now , she helps him rehabilitate other domestic abusers . global newsit was only when he joined change of seasons , a north vancouver group formed in 1992 to help perpetrators of domestic violence , that fossella started to voice the trauma he ’ d tried to cope with by turning to alcohol . in a room of men whose stories felt so much like his own , fossella began to unpack the trauma of his childhood . story continues below advertisementin that room , he finally spoke at length about how his father abused his mother and about how his father abused him . in that room , he finally felt comfortable speaking about a secret he had never shared with anyone : as a four - year - old child , he was sexually abused by a buddhist monk . he says immediately after the assault , he didn ’ t fully understand the gravity of what had happened to him , until the monk put his finger to his lips and said : “ shhh . ” “ as soon as he made that noise , instantly my father came to my mind . is my father going to beat me up when he finds out what this man has done to me ? ” fossella says . the likelihood of being abused as a kid is much higher for indigenous children , according to a statistics canada survey . forty per cent of respondents reported being sexually or physically abused or both as a child , more than the 29 per cent of non - indigenous respondents who reported such abuse . it isn ’ t unusual for survivors like fossella to keep childhood sexual abuse a secret , jillian roberts , a child psychologist and associate professor at the university of victoria , told global news earlier this year . story continues below advertisement “ i believe that many , many people are abused without telling anyone , ” roberts said . “ sexual abuse still has a stigma in our society . ” after two series of sessions with change of seasons , fossella told joyce and his family about the abuse he had suffered . it proved to be the breakthrough he needed , although it would be two full years before joyce finally felt safe around her husband . “ even though he stopped and he was taking the program , he had made changes , i still didn ’ t trust it . i still had that fear . ” tweet thisthat journey shaped how the couple leads warriors against violence . disclosing past traumas is a key to breaking the cycle of violence and substance abuse plaguing too many canadian families , fossella believes . “ i became an alcoholic trying to smother those things , ” he says . “ it took me 43 years . ” and so , every monday night , fossella sits in a circle with a room full of men and women — indigenous and non - indigenous alike — and relives the worst of his past . when fossella holds the feather , he speaks about the abuse he suffered and the abuse he inflicted . speaking about it takes a toll , he says , but that pales in comparison to the freedom he feels from having nothing to hide . story continues below advertisement “ we ’ re all born with compassion … and i became hard , but now i ’ m very much open to help other people , ” fossella says . “ i have no more secrets . ” tweet thisto read the full broken series , go here . for a list of resources if you need help , go here . our reporting doesn ’ t end here . do you have a story of violence against women , trans or non -

__label__relevant homeless , pregnant , covid - positive — and bearing the brunt of a pandemic inside a labour and delivery room at toronto ' s michael garron hospital , diamond is in her bed , steeling herself for the birth of her first child . outside the door , a sign warns hospital staff to take " droplet precautions " before entering . diamond ' s midwife jenna bly is by her side , dressed head - to - toe in protective equipment — a gown layered over her scrubs and tucked into her gloves , with her face mask leaving only her eyes visible to her frightened client . on this day in april , diamond is nine months pregnant . homeless . a victim of domestic abuse . and , as of less than a day earlier , officially covid - positive . diamond wonders if she ' s dying . bly worries what will happen if she does . the midwife broaches a grim subject : how to prepare a living will for her client , who ' s just in her 30s , and whose only symptom — so far — has been a bit of a cough . " i didn ' t want this baby to just go into the foster system without any plan . i wanted to know what she wanted for the baby , " bly later recalls . " so we spent the few hours before the baby was born coordinating with various supports , to create an emergency plan if she were to go on a ventilator . " she pauses . " it ' s not something i usually do at a birth . " but these are not typical times . diamond , whose identity cbc news is concealing to protect her safety , is among the most vulnerable members of society — a new immigrant who fled her toronto home after a violent assault , forcing her into the city ' s shelter system with no clear path to stable housing . researchers and advocates alike believe she ' s just one example of the kind of person covid - 19 strikes the hardest . in a city like toronto , there are more of these people than you ' d think . " unfortunately , her story is shockingly not uncommon , " says kaitlin schwan , senior researcher at the canadian observatory on homelessness . " for folks on the front lines , you ' re really just trying to scrape together resources to support someone in this situation . " pandemic ' sheds light on inequalities ' it ' s been close to four months since toronto ' s first suspected case of covid - 19 . since then , roughly 24 , 000 people have been confirmed infected across the province , with more than 2 , 000 ontarians dying to date . research from ices , a not - for - profit research institute , suggests many of those positive cases have come from marginalized communities — neighbourhoods where poverty and housing instability intersect . " this pandemic sheds light on inequalities we have already , " says dr . astrid guttmann , chief science officer at ices and a physician at sickkids hospital . compared with ontarians not tested for covid - 19 , those tested — and those confirmed positive — were more likely to live in neighbourhoods with greater residential instability , material deprivation and dependency , and lower income status , the research found . those confirmed positive also were more likely to live in communities with a relatively greater concentration of immigrants and visible minorities . the findings are still preliminary , but so far the results aren ' t surprising , guttmann adds . that ' s because researchers have long known poverty and marginalization put people at a greater risk of poor health , which can be tied to any combination of factors from high stress levels , to food insecurity , to crowded — or nonexistent — housing . " what covid has done is just made this unignorable , " says dr . andrew boozary , an assistant professor at the university of toronto ' s dalla lana school of public health . " but we ' ve ignored it and been willfully blind to these outcomes for decades . " waiting for test results , pregnant and aloneit ' s now may , and diamond is sitting in the lobby of a downtown hotel , holding her weeks - old baby girl . the newborn is wrapped up in a white blanket with little pink polka dots with her face covered by a black - and - white striped towel . her mother speaks slowly , her quiet voice muffled by her blue surgical mask . " i ' m in canada by myself . i don ' t have family here , " she says . diamond moved here from ethiopia five years ago . earlier this year , she first entered a toronto women ' s shelter after fleeing domestic abuse , and while she ' s not sure if that ' s where she caught the disease during the third trimester of her pregnancy , it ' s a possibility . " in the shelter , i lived in one room with three people , " she explains . " sharing the washroom — everything . " toronto midwife jenna bly demonstrates the level of personal protective equipment she now wears while helping vulnerable covid - positive clients . ( evan mitsui / cbc ) that ' s where she first met bly , who has spent the last year - and - a - half working with precariously - housed clients as the creator and co - lead for south riverdale community health centre ' s match midwives program , a role she shares with fellow co - lead shezeen suleman . after diamond tested positive for covid - 19 , the hours leading up to her delivery in mid - april were full of fear and uncertainty for both women . for bly , who is married with three little girls of her own , it marked her first time helping deliver a baby for a covid - positive mother . while getting ready to head to the hospital , she wondered if she was putting her own family at risk . " there ' s this deadly virus ravaging the world , and i had to be in the room with it , " bly says . " then i got in the room , with this person that i knew , and i was just providing care . " thankfully , after delivering a healthy baby , her client didn ' t need to use the end - of - life directives in her living will — her symptoms never worsened beyond a cough . but who was going to care for her now , this new mother with a contagious disease ? at the urging of bly and the midwife team , diamond and her newborn were later admitted to toronto ' s so - called " covid hotel . " there , on a site near an industrial area of the city — the exact location is being kept secret from the general public — residents experiencing both homelessness and covid - 19 are able to recover under the city ' s watch . ' the only lasting solution is housing ' the 200 - bed recovery facility opened in april in partnership with the university health network , inner city health associates and other community health providers , and provides medical support and meals to clients and even toys , which are cleaned in between uses , for their children . so far , more than 210 people like diamond have come and gone , with close to 80 clients currently staying at the site . mary - anne bédard , general manager of toronto ' s shelter , support and housing administration , says a second site opened on may 16 in a downtown location , which is providing a space for people awaiting test results and close contacts of confirmed or suspected cases . bédard says these sites are opening at " record speed . " others say the city lagged behind in its efforts , leaving too many homeless residents stuck in the close quarters of toronto ' s jam - packed shelter system as the city ' s case count kept rising . " it certainly was a catalyst for spread , " says rafi aaron , a spokesperson for the toronto - based interfaith coalition to fight homelessness . " because , at the best of times , the conditions people were in were breeding grounds for covid - 19 . " crowded shelters , like other congregate settings , have proved to be a flash point for transmission . as of may 20 , toronto has experienced 352 covid - 19 cases tied to outbreaks in the shelter system . dr . andrew boozary , an assistant professor at university of toronto ' s dalla lana school of public heath , was co - lead on the project . ( university health network ) " the primary policy intervention has been ' stay at home , ' but that ' s not something we can do amid housing precarity , " stresses schwan , who is also co - chair for the recently - launched women ' s national housing and homelessness network . " we finally understand the centrality of housing to well - being — to health care — because of covid . " boozary , the assistant professor at u of t , calls housing " the only lasting solution . " with covid - 19 further exposing the health disparities and vulnerabilities of marginalized residents , he says all levels of government need to build strategies to house all canadians . and sooner , not later , amid growing fears the cases among the country ' s poor and homeless could keep rising , with a ripple effect long after the pandemic ends . " being able to provide people with decent comfortable housing has health - care benefits , cost benefits , economic benefits , " boozary says . " and most importantly , there ' s human dignity . " slipping through the cracksfor diamond , the covid - 19 crisis is just another hurdle she didn ' t need . after recovering from her illness at the " covid hotel , " she was sent to her current living quarters in another city - operated hotel room , kilometres away , with her baby . she ' s not sure where she ' ll go next . bly , who is still checking on diamond with the match midwives team , is trying to connect her to housing providers , hoping to find her a permanent roof over her head . but with years - long wait lists for social housing , the future looks bleak . bly worries her client , and others like her , will simply slip through the cracks . diamond speaks to cbc news reporter lauren pelley in the lobby of a downtown toronto hotel while cradling her infant daughter . ( evan mitsui / cbc ) while speaking to cbc news in the hotel lobby , diamond starts crying , her soft voice cracking . " i ' ve struggled too much in my life , by myself , shelter to shelter , " she says . " no one can understand what happened in your life . sometimes i ' m sad . angry . shouting , because so many things are happening in my life… " she trails off , still holding her newborn . " so many hopes i have , " she says . " i need for my baby a house — to live by myself , and take care of my baby . " 
__label__relevant wiff documentary shines spotlight on female genital mutilation ask giselle portenier why she chose to travel to tanzania for her latest documentary , and she ' ll say that tanzania actually chose her . according to the self - described human rights filmmaker , whose latest project in the name of your daughter is set to screen at this year ' s windsor international film festival ( wiff ) , it was actually a google alert about female genital mutilation ( fgm ) that led portenier to her next project . " i was looking for a story that might be accessible to my audience , that people could engage with , " said portenier . " i had [set] a google alert about female genital mutilation for about five years , and one day , this story popped up about a safehouse that saves girls from their own parents so that they won ' t be mutilated . " as a documentarian , portenier has spent much of her career making films about the human rights of women and children around the world . " i ' ve made films about honour killings in pakistan and child slavery in africa , " she said . " female genital mutilation is something that had always eluded me , but i always felt was a very important topic . " listen to gisele portenier discuss her film on windsor morning : female genital mutilation is the subject of a documentary screening at the windsor international film festival . if you think it ' s something that only affects women in far - flung countries , you ' re be mistaken . tony speaks with director giselle portenier about why this film , and this difficult subject , is something all canadians should pay attention to . 8 : 54when portenier came across the safehouse in tanzania — run by rhobi samwelly , who is heavily featured in portenier ' s latest film — she knew she had a responsibility to tell the story of the women and girls who rely on the organization for security . " my film is really about the voices of the girls , the voices of the children who are running away to save themsleves from female genital mutilation and the child marriage that follows thereafter , " portenier said . still , while the film touches on a topic that has affected hundreds of millions of girls around the world — including almost 100 , 000 girls and women in canada — portenier said she hopes audiences leave the documentary inspired . wiff executive director vincent georgie says the festival doesn ' t shy away from films that portray complicated subject matter . ( katerina georgieva / cbc ) " [i hope] audiences walk away from it inspired by the children , because some of them are only eight - years - old , " she said . " imagine an eight - year - old risking her life and her family by running away from home , just so she won ' t have to go through the mutilation that she ' s heard about perhaps at school and knows is a risk to her life and her future . " vincent georgie , executive director and chief programmer of wiff , said the festival doesn ' t shy away from films that cover sensitive topics , adding that in the name of your daughter is a " very important film to show at the festival , and one that we believe in very much . " " one of the luxuries of running a large film festival like ours , is you ' re able to bring in all sorts of different films for different audiences and different points of view , " he said . " and we ' ve never shied away from films that are challenging our films that are different or films that provoke or make you think . " ' i hope it ' s educational , ' says survivorfrancis cole , a survivor of female genital mutilation , who advocates for women and girls around the world by sharing her own story , said she ' s portenier ' s film educates audiences , rather than presenting an inaccurate view of the issue . " i hope that this has a message of educating people about the practice , " she said . " i just hope that they ' ll be made more aware if they ' re not already aware about what fgm is . " cole said she also hopes portneir ' s film acknowledges that fgm isn ' t just a practice maintained by any one particular religious group . francis cole is a female genital mutilation survivor who advocates against the practice . ( amy dodge / cbc ) " when people hear about fgm , they automatically think it ' s a muslim thing , " said cole , who has yet to see in the name of your daughter . " i was raised catholic and i wasn ' t spared . " cole added that she hopes audiences understand that fgm is a " global issue . " " it ' s a human rights violation , " she said . " it ' s torture and it has lifelong consequence and it ' s happening all around us . it ' s no longer happening in some remote village in a country in africa . " speaking about the subject , portenier acknowledged that an important thing to note is that fgm " doesn ' t have anything to do with religion . " " [in] the safehouse , for instance , there are children from muslim communities , children from christian communties and also from animist traditions , " she said . fgm is about ' sexual control of girls , ' says filmmakerwhile many might believe female genital mutilation is a cultural practice , portenier said the truth is far less complicated . " the common denominator everywhere is sexual control of girls , " she said . " it ' s thought that if you put a girl through female genital mutilation , she won ' t be having sex before marriage , and then she won ' t be having affairs — be unfaithful — during marriage . " at the same time , portenier wants her audience to understand that topics like female genital mutilation don ' t just take place in so - called " other " parts of the world . " there are 200 million survivors and every 11 seconds somewhere in the world , a girl is going through fgm and that ' s a lot of children , " she said . " it ' s also a canadian issue … because we have upwards of 100 , 000 survivors in canada and these women are not getting the support that they need . " " and we have girls at risk . government documents show that girls are being taken in the summer months back to their home country to be cut . " windsor refugee settlement agency connects fgm survivors with access to caremike morency , executive director of windsor ' s matthew house refugee welcome centre , echoed portenier ' s comments about fgm survivors in canada . according to morency , his agency has seen an increase in women fleeing to canada to escape fgm or who have already experienced the issue . " we ' re certainly seen an increase in the number of people fleeing to canada , and while that ' s not the exclusive reason for their refugee claim , it is part of their story , " he said . matthew house executive director mike morency says access to trauma counselling is essential for survivors of female genital mutilation . ( chris ensing / cbc ) as for how matthew house provides support to survivors , morency said an important part of the work he does is " connecting them with counsellors , trauma experts to deal with the experiences that they have had prior to coming to canada . " " depending on the depth of their trauma , we would want to try to make sure that they get connected with a counselor that has trauma treatment experience and help them walk through that process , " morency said . 
__label__relevant migrant farm workers vulnerable to sexual violence : u of t expert after teresa filed a report against her farm employer for sexual assault , he asked her how much money it would take for her to retract her statement . in the spring of 2014 , teresa ( not her real name ) was attacked by her boss on his farm in british columbia . on the day the assault occurred , the boss sent teresa ’ s male co - workers to another farm for the day , leaving her and another female farm worker behind . while they were trellising grape vines , the women ran out of twine . teresa ’ s boss told her to come and get more twine inside a shed , where she says he forced his mouth onto hers and began grabbing her inappropriately . she managed to shake off his grip and run back to her co - worker in the vineyard for support . it was her word against his , and the crown decided there wasn ’ t enough evidence to proceed with the charges . in canada , 46 per cent of women survivors don ’ t even report sexual assault because they think there is insufficient proof . teresa is a single mom from baja california , mexico . since 2012 , she has been supporting her parents and two daughters by spending up to eight months each year on canadian farms through the seasonal agricultural worker program ( sawp ) . teresa was concerned that speaking up about the sexual assault might hurt her and her female co - worker ’ s future job chances . she says mexico ’ s secretariat of labour and social welfare verbally warns sawp workers each season before they leave mexico : “ ‘you ’ re coming to canada to work , not to cause problems . ’ if you complain about something , they kick you out of the program . ” elise hjalmarson ( author provided ) after the assault , teresa was transferred to a small vegetable farm , where her new employer provided accommodations in a rodent - infested trailer without a functional lock . teresa ’ s attacker lived in the adjacent village in british columbia ’ s southern interior . she suffered from recurrent nightmares . “ i was afraid . i thought he was going to show up or that he was going to do something to me . ” our connections with migrant women survivors of sexual assault are based on field research we have conducted since 2013 with migrant farm workers in canada . we are also volunteer members of grassroots advocacy organizations in british columbia and ontario that provide front - line support for farm workers . canada ’ s sawp is the main agricultural stream of the temporary foreign worker program . it began in 1966 in response to lobbying from farmers and that year in ontario , 264 jamaican workers were hired . since then , the program has expanded to all canadian provinces , bringing workers from mexico and 11 caribbean countries . in 2017 , approximately 40 , 000 workers came to canada as a part of the sawp – around 7 , 500 to british columbia . of those , less than four per cent were women . the structure of the sawp heightens the power imbalance between workers and employers , amplifying women ’ s vulnerability to sexual assault . work permits are tied to a specific employer , so getting fired typically means getting deported . workers in abusive workplaces often have difficulty transferring to a new boss . to be rehired the following season , a farm worker must receive a positive evaluation from their employer . power imbalancesthe sawp requirements effectively deter worker complaints about labour practices , housing conditions , workplace injuries or violence . the sawp contains no pathway to citizenship , even for men and women who have worked in canada for decades . workers and critics of the program argue that permanently categorizing migrants as “ non - citizens ” means they have fewer rights and protections than canadian workers . the sawp has been a boon for growers , who have access to a seemingly unending pool of workers whose urgent need for income makes them unlikely to dissent . alongside the temporary foreign worker program , a smaller number of migrants arrive in canada on tourist visas and work under the table during the harvest . luz ( not her real name ) , a 30 - year - old actor from sonora , mexico , was one such tourist . in the summer of 2015 , luz arrived in british columbia hoping to work for a few months to save some money to pay off her student loans . while employed on a cherry orchard in the similkameen valley , her boss sexually assaulted her . on the day she was attacked , her boss sent her co - workers to other parts of the farm and then grabbed her while she was walking through an empty storehouse . he forcibly groped her and began kissing her neck . luz demanded he stop and tried pushing him away , but he was significantly bigger than her . her mind was racing , “ i ’ m all alone , no one ’ s around , i could run , i could yell . but if i yell , who ’ s going to hear me ? a thousand things came into my head , and i didn ’ t know what to do . ” after much deliberation , luz decided not to go report the groping to the canadian police as she feared deportation . while sexual assault in general is the most underreported violent crime in canada , a precarious citizenship status presents an additional barrier to reporting for migrant women ( both undocumented and government - authorized ) . both teresa and luz said a fear of deportation was a major factor in deciding whether to report their assaults . both women knew of other workers who had been sent home for complaining to authorities about living conditions , workplace injuries , bullying and harassment . solidarity with #metoo across north americadespite immense injustices for migrant women , there are slow signs of change . in 2015 , the human rights tribunal of ontario awarded more than $200 , 000 to two sisters from mexico hired under the temporary foreign worker program . the tribunal found that presteve foods , a fish - packing plant in ontario , had created a “ sexually poisoned work environment . ” thirty - nine migrant women from thailand and mexico participated as complainants . the woman who received the highest damages , known as o . p . t . , described how the former plant owner forced her to perform sexual acts , threatening deportation if she didn ’ t comply . in her statement , o . p . t . highlighted how canada ’ s migrant worker program continues to create the conditions for abuse : “ under the temporary foreign worker program , the boss has all the power – over your money , house , status , everything …that happened to me eight years ago , and the system is still the same . ” amid the pressure for systemic change from movements like #metoo and times up , farm worker women are pointing to the specific ways race , class and gender can amplify women ’ s risk of workplace sexual abuse . in november , the alianza nacional de campesinas , representing more than 700 , 000 women farm workers in the united states , released a letter in solidarity with hollywood actors who had survived sexual assault , highlighting the gender inequity that pervades both industries . the coalition of immokalee workers ( ciw ) , a farm worker - led organization , has been calling on the wendy ’ s fast - food chain to sign onto an independent workplace monitoring program that would help prevent sexual violence in fields where the restaurant ’ s tomatoes are produced . after a five - day freedom fast , ciw farm worker women marched in new york city . some were accompanied by their daughters . solutions for a better futuredespite all the pain she has experienced in canada , teresa says thinking about her own daughters gives her the strength to keep going . as part of a cultural shift toward gender equity , we need to revamp canada ’ s laws , institutions and policies to better protect all women , including farm workers . the b . c . government has promised to establish a registry that could help prevent migrant workers from being charged illegal recruitment fees , which is a positive starting point . as supported by u . s . research on sexual assault services , provinces could also set up anonymous , toll - free and multilingual crisis hotlines for workers , including those who are undocumented . to address the multiple barriers faced by migrant farm worker women to health care , researchers have recommended enrolling workers in provincial health - care plans instead of private insurance schemes . free legal services and english - language classes could also strengthen women ’ s ability to assert their rights . workers should have the right to a fair appeal process before deportation . ultimately , the canadian government should eliminate tied work permits and provide migrant workers with full immigration status , two steps that would immediately lessen the disproportionate power of the employer . such changes would also go a long way toward ensuring that those who do the vital work of growing the food we eat receive the respect , freedom and dignity they deserve . anelyse weiler is a phd candidate in sociology and pierre elliott trudeau foundation scholar at the university of toronto . this article was originally published on the conversation . read the original article . 
__label__relevant forced marriage in canada ' more prevalent ' than thought : ex - child bride samra zafar was just 16 years old when her mother told her she would be marrying a 28 - year - old man in canada . against her wishes , zafar left her pakistani family ’ s home in the united arab emirates and started a new life with her husband in mississauga , ont . over the next decade , she endured “ abuse of all kinds ” as she raised two daughters and tried desperately to obtain a university education and get out of her marriage . she eventually succeeded and is now speaking out about child brides and forced marriage – a problem she says is prevalent , even in canada . “ it ’ s actually shocking how much it happens here , ” zafar , who is now a successful financial services professional , speaker and human rights activist , told ctv ’ s your morning on thursday . “ since i have started speaking up about it , i get approached by women and girls all the time . ” forcing very young girls into marriage is a serious problem all around the world , activists say . in canada , marriage laws vary among provinces and territories , with the legal age of marriage generally set at 18 . however , in many provinces , a person with consent from both parents can be married at age 16 or 17 . those exceptions can lead to forced marriage because the bride ’ s consent is not explicitly sought , said saadya hamdani of plan canada , an international organization that supports social justice for children in developing countries . “ the cultural value that is attached to marriage is a very big problem , ” hamdani told ctv ’ s your morning . it is estimated that , each year , 15 million girls around the world are married before the age of 18 . in september 2013 , the south asian legal clinic of ontario released a report that counted 219 confirmed or suspected cases of forced marriage in ontario and quebec from 2010 to 2012 . in 57 per cent of the cases , people were taken out of canada to get married . the report said that forced marriage can “ happen to anyone regardless of gender , religion or age . ” zafar , who has been speaking about the issue in canadian high schools , said she is sometimes approached by teachers who tell her about girls in grades 10 , 11 or 12 , who go to their family ’ s country of origin for the summer and don ’ t come back because they end up getting married there . “ it ’ s more prevalent than we all think because no one talks about it , ” she said . “ there ’ s a veil of honour that covers this whole issue . it ’ s hush - hush . ” zafar said girls are usually not aware of their rights if they live in cultures and families that condition them to think that getting married is their “ ultimate destiny ” and a girl ’ s “ sole purpose ” she believed that herself , until she came to canada and suffered abuse at the hands of her husband . zafar was able to secretly save enough money to get an education at the university of toronto , where she excelled and realized for the first time that what she experienced at home was abuse . she left her husband and continued to pursue her education as a single mother , while also working multiple jobs . she obtained a master ’ s degree in economics with the highest distinction , won multiple scholarships and awards , and is now the youngest alumnus serving as a university of toronto governor . zafar is now a sought - after speaker on the topics of domestic violence , gender inequality and female empowerment . “ it ’ s my mission now to bring awareness to this issue , ” she said .

__label__no_relevant andrew scheer falls short — but vows conservatives will be ready next time conservative leader andrew scheer ran his party ' s federal election campaign as a referendum on the performance of justin trudeau and the liberals over the last four years . now the results are in : a minority government for trudeau , a slightly larger caucus for the conservatives — and new pressure on scheer ' s leadership . beyond a promise to voters to make life more affordable through tax cuts , scheer said canadians should back conservatives in this election because trudeau had lost the " moral authority to govern " after the snc - lavalin scandal and the brownface photos surfaced . a substantial number of canadians disagreed . while scheer did not pick up enough seats to form a government , he did hold trudeau to a minority . but more than that , the conservative party appears to have won the popular vote thanks in part to lopsided victories in the west . in his address to party supporters monday , scheer gave no indication that he would be resigning his position as leader . " while tonight ' s result isn ' t what we wanted , i ' m also incredibly proud , proud of our team and proud of the bigger and stronger conservative team that we ' ll send to ottawa , " scheer said . andrew scheer says the conservatives are the ' government in waiting ' conservative leader andrew scheer says he ' s looking forward to heading back to ottawa with a bigger conservative team while speaking to reporters in regina , sask . 1 : 29 " tonight , conservatives have put justin trudeau on notice and mr . trudeau , when your government falls , conservatives will be ready and we will win . " scheer failed to substantially bolster his party ' s standings in the house of commons . the conservatives return to parliament with roughly 20 more seats than former prime minister stephen harper won in 2015 . in once deep - blue ridings in places like atlantic canada and ontario , liberal candidates managed to fight off their conservative challengers . the party failed to make any gains in quebec . deputy party leader lisa raitt , a conservative stalwart and a red tory , went down to defeat in the suburban toronto riding of milton . conservative deputy leader lisa raitt loses in milton , ont . in her concession speech , ontario conservative candidate lisa raitt says it has been an honour to serve as the deputy leader of her party . 0 : 51the conservative election strategy — sticking to tried - and - true conservative policies like tax cuts while rejecting substantive climate action to motivate the dedicated tory base — failed to sway enough independent - minded voters in central and eastern canada . scheer was able to tap into the palpable anger in western canada — particularly in the prairies , where the liberal government has been accused of stifling the oil and gas sector with policies like the northern b . c . oil tanker ban and the controversial overhaul of the environmental assessment regime . conservative candidates toppled all liberal mps in alberta and saskatchewan , including long - time liberal mp and cabinet minister ralph goodale . in alberta , conservative candidates secured an eye - popping 70 per cent of the vote . in saskatchewan , tories swept all the seats with more than 67 per cent of the vote . but scheer ' s future as conservative leader is now in doubt . scheer said monday ' s result is just the " first step " and the popular vote success of the party in this election means that the conservatives are now the " government in waiting . " under the conservative party constitution , if the party fails to form government — and if the leader has not yet formally signalled an intention to resign — then delegates can vote at the next party convention to hold a leadership race . if more more than 50 per cent of the votes cast at the convention favour such an option , that would trigger a leadership race . of course , scheer might resign before that leadership review vote is even necessary . andrew scheer ' s full election night speechconservative leader andrew scheer speaks to supporters in regina , sask . scheer won his regina - qu ' appelle riding . 10 : 44while trudeau ' s campaign was beset by scandal , scheer also faced questions about his resume and his political positions . scheer appeared awkward when asked about social issues like gay marriage and abortion . there were also questions about his past as an insurance broker ( he was never actually licensed to sell insurance ) and his dual canada - u . s . citizenship . scheer was first elected in his adopted hometown of regina in 2004 , beating long - time ndp mp lorne nystrom . after years on the conservative backbench in opposition and then in government , scheer served as deputy speaker in the house of commons before taking the big chair himself after the 2011 election . conservative party members were forced to pick a new leader after their electoral thumping in 2015 . at the outset of that leadership race , scheer struggled to stand out in the crowded field of 17 candidates who were vying to replace stephen harper . scheer , while speaker of the house of commons , jokingly tries to fight with then - prime minister stephen harper and then - ndp leader jack layton as they escort him to the speaker ' s chair in june 2011 . ( adrian wyld / canadian press ) with media attention focused on higher - profile candidates like kellie leitch , kevin o ' leary and maxime bernier , scheer quietly assembled a significant amount of " second choice " support among members . he courted socially conservative voters — a not - insignificant portion of the conservative leadership voting base — but also more moderate elements of the party who feared bernier ' s strident libertarianism would be a turn - off for the general voting public . he narrowly beat bernier by less than two points on the 13th and final ballot . scheer acknowledged early on that his policy proposals were not all that different from those of his predecessor . he willingly embraced the " stephen harper with a smile " label , saying he would govern like harper but with a less stern image . when he assumed the helm of his party , the liberals were still flying high in the polls . scheer is congratulated by maxime bernier after being elected the new leader of the federal conservative party in 2017 . ( frank gunn / canadian press ) but scheer scored some wins as an opposition leader , like a come - from - behind victory in a quebec byelection . he capitalized on liberal scandals — like trudeau ' s much - maligned trip to india — and some ethical lapses , like trudeau ' s trip to a private island in the bahamas . with the snc - lavalin affair , scheer sought to paint trudeau as a man unfit to govern after inappropriately pressuring his justice minister . his efforts paid off in the early months of 2019 as liberal popular support numbers dipped significantly . scheer launched the election campaign with a promise to make life more affordable for canadians ( " it ' s time for you to get ahead " was the chosen slogan ) , by promising to revive harper - era policies that were dismantled by the liberals . scheer committed to a children ' s fitness and arts tax credit , a public transit tax credit , a new green home retrofit tax credit and a " universal tax cut " to slash income taxes for middle - income canadians .

" by then , everyone had seen , even the little ones , " said junior ' s mother , maria benites . years ago , a child would never have been permitted to see a victim of jejuvy . these days , you can hardly prevent it . after junior , the deaths came swiftly , a 15 - year - old boy , a 14 - year - old girl . until the last to die : junior ' s brother , gilmar , who strangled himself with a belt on a post inside the family ' s rough board house in october . " they were not sad boys – they were normal , " ms . benites told me , her voice flat . " they liked school . they played football . they went to dances . they were always together . " something happened to them . " story continues below advertisementmaria benites looks at a photo of one of the two sons she lost to suicide over the past 15 months at her home on the reserve in sassoró . parallels to a canadian crisisthere is a suicide crisis among brazil ' s indigenous people , who take their own lives at an average rate 22 times that of non - indigenous brazilians . among the non - indigenous brazilian population , it is men over 60 who are most likely to kill themselves ( a statistic that is in line with most western countries ) ; on brazilian reserves , it is almost entirely adolescents who take their own lives . more boys kill themselves than girls , but the rate of suicide by girls is growing more quickly . the overall indigenous suicide rate is higher than the national one across the country , but it is wildly higher in a handful of places . the situation has many parallels with the phenomenon of indigenous suicide in canada , with one conspicuous difference : in canada , it is called a " crisis . " prime minister justin trudeau has pledged urgent action on indigenous suicide , and cabinet ministers have promised a federal intervention ( although indigenous leaders say both a plan and resources are still starkly lacking ) . in brazil , however , there is no talk of a crisis . in 2015 the federal government announced a prevention plan for what it calls the worst - affected reserves ( pledging to cut suicide by 10 per cent ) but it will not make public the budget or where that plan is supposedly being implemented . this belated and haphazard response reflects , in part , the fact that the country is mired in economic and political turmoil that has pulled away resources and attention from most social problems . but even at the best of times , brazil ' s 900 , 000 indigenous people are profoundly marginalized , the poorest citizens , little remembered , less served . no more than a dozen people in brazil , a country of 210 million , are researching the possible causes of the astronomical rates of indigenous suicide . community - level resources are pitifully scarce : for the 70 , 000 indigenous people in the state of mato grosso do sul , where sassoró is located , there are 13 psychologists , none with more than an undergraduate degree . it is difficult to determine precisely when this problem began , because data are predictably scarce : a federal indigenous health service has kept statistics only since the mid - 1990s . but suicides – occurring in such large numbers , not just one or two in a generation – are by all accounts a recent phenomenon . most people the age of ms . benites , who is 52 , say it never happened when she was young . the phenomenon first drew attention in brazil with a spate of suicides among her people , the guarani - kaiowa , in 1986 , when the brazilian indigenous affairs agency noticed a spike – from about five a year to 40 . statistics collected since 1996 show an average of 46 a year – a rate that is 21 times greater than the national one . many of those who work in the field say this is probably a sharp underestimation , since indigenous deaths are almost never subjected to a coroner ' s analysis , and are often simply not recorded at all . são gabriel da cachoeira suicide hot spots boa vista state of roraima tabatinga state of amazonas brazil state of mato grosso do sul bolivia dourados amambai sassoró traditional guarani - kaiowa territory argentina uruguay the globe and mail , source : indigenous peoples rights ( cti ) and instituto socioambiental ( isa ) suicide hot spots boa vista são gabriel da cachoeira state of roraima tabatinga state of amazonas brazil state of mato grosso do sul peru bolivia dourados amambai sassoró traditional guarani - kaiowa territory argentina uruguay the globe and mail , source : indigenous peoples rights ( cti ) and instituto socioambiental ( isa ) suicide hot spots boa vista são gabriel da cachoeira state of roraima tabatinga state of amazonas brazil state of mato grosso do sul peru bolivia dourados amambai sassoró traditional guarani - kaiowa territory argentina uruguay the globe and mail , source : indigenous peoples rights ( cti ) and instituto socioambiental ( isa ) among the suspects : chronic disease , drug abuseas a series of suicides by young girls in northern saskatchewan made news in canada in recent months , i went to sassoró , and to reserves scattered through guarani - kaiowa territory , to try to understand what is happening here , and what , if anything , is being done in response . i talked to the psychologist whose catchment area includes the benites family ; to the regional health authority ; to traditional healers and to anthropologists ; to parents and siblings of the dead . story continues below advertisementwhen i asked people why they thought the young guarani - kaiowa are killing themselves , they told me about lost land and lost rituals , and the lure of the city and fancy sneakers and cellphones . about chronic disease and near - universal unemployment . about alcohol and drug abuse , and a generation of children whose parents feel they cannot control them . ( and a generation of children who feel their parents should not try to control them . ) i heard about the nature of the kaiowa , some of whom described their people to me as closed , reserved , disinclined to share emotion but prone to sticking fiercely to an idea once it has entered their minds . and i heard about the mokoi and gwyra , the birds of protection that can be startled away . that explanation , in the end , made as much sense as any of the others . brazil has 900 , 000 indigenous people , and 480 " demarcated territories " encompassing just over a million square kilometres , 12 per cent of the country ' s land – land set aside for indigenous people to live on . ( indians , as they are almost universally known here , have no ownership rights , or control of minerals or anything else beneath the soil . ) some 400 , 000 of those indigenous people live away from those demarcated territories , in rural areas or in cities . the indigenous people of the amazon rain forest , with their bowl haircuts and yellow feather headdresses that are a national geographic staple , are the archetypical brazilian indian . and 98 per cent of the demarcated indigenous land is in the amazon . but the second - largest indigenous population in the country is here in mato grosso do sul , a state on the western flank of brazil that shares a border with paraguay and bolivia . there are eight first nations in the state – " ethnicities , " they are called in brazil ; the largest , by far , is the guarani - kaiowa , who make up two - thirds of the indigenous population and whose traditional territory is today fractured between the three countries . on the brazilian side of the border , the guarani - kaiowa have nine reserves in the south of mato grosso do sul . this is breadbasket territory , the heart of brazil ' s thriving industrial agriculture business . the land is a vast sea of green fields of soy , spiky sugar cane , and darker green corn , owned by a handful of giant firms , many of them multinationals . while the rest of brazil staggers under the weight of a stalled economy , plenty of money is still being made here : the asian market ' s hunger for brazilian soy , and for beef fed on soy , has not dimmed . once in a long while the farmland is interrupted by a town , built around a plaza , with a handful of clothing stores and gift shops , a couple of bakeries , and lines of big trucks idling at the one traffic light . you can drive for 15 or 20 minutes at a stretch and pass only fields that are pasture for white brahman cows . after a while , you realize that far more land here has been given to cows than to indigenous humans . the reserves are unmarked ; you have to know what you are looking for to find them , down long , rutted , red dirt roads . eventually there are houses in among the scrubby bush – the best ones a couple of low rooms with plaster over mud brick ; the poorest , such as that of ms . benites , just tarp pulled over sticks . each reserve has a school , where all classes except guarani language are taught in portuguese . the schools are chronically short of teachers and the most basic quality control . just 5 , 400 indigenous people in the state have made it as far as the first year of high school . there is usually a small health post on each reserve , where for a few hours each day an " indigenous health agent " vaccinates babies and doles out tuberculosis medication . there are plenty of trees between the houses , and a sense of spaciousness ; there is also a total absence of any kind of economic activity . the teacher and the health agent are the only people on most reserves with paid employment . the only jobs to be had are day labour on the farms , a few months a year during harvest – but farmers don ' t like to hire " índios . " sometimes women get jobs washing clothes or floors for white people in the town – but it ' s far , and the work pays only about $20 a day . brazil ' s indigenous people had their first interactions with european colonizers in 1500 , along the atlantic coast . so , some of them have more than 500 years ' experience dealing with the mundo branco , the white world . but colonialism came much later to the deep interior of the country . the first plantation land grants in mato grosso ( " thick forest " in portuguese ) were doled out to white settlers in the 1800s , but a major effort to control the movements of the indigenous people began only in 1915 . for decades , most of the guarani - kaiowa managed to stay away from the reserves , and kept to the forests . but by the 1970s , the last swaths of forest were being cut down for cattle ranches and maté plantations , and the government drove the guarani - kaiowa off their land and into small reserves . the pain of the displacement was then compounded : before they were moved , the indigenous occupants were forced to act as slave labour , clearing the land for the new farms , and building the roads that would serve them ; some were obliged to continue for generations as unpaid farm workers . the relocation was , by all accounts , a catastrophe for the guarani - kaiowa . they were a semi - nomadic people used to ranging over large distances , suddenly denied access to their traditional means of supporting themselves . the forests were razed , the wild animals they hunted disappeared , and the water sources were drained to irrigate plantations . the relocations upended the guarani - kaiowa in another , terrible way : particular places are essential for the practice of their rituals for planting , for hunting , for marriages and treating illness . a family ' s tekoha , its original and sacred land , is the source of teko pora – words that mean , essentially , to be alive and well . when they were " interned " – that is the word people usually use to describe the dislocation – everything began to fall apart . left : youth in the village of limão verde on the amambai indigenous reserve pay desultory attention to a cultural presentation intended to build self - esteem . right : amambai rsidents attend a community meeting organized by sesai , brazil ’ s indigenous health agency . the agency has launched a new initiative to engage community elders and service providers such as police officers and pastors in efforts to lower the rate at which guarani - kaiowa people , particularly teens , take their own lives . ' lots of things now are out of control ' " the deaths , the murders , the suicides – they have to do with how we live now , " izaaque joão , who lectures on guarani - kaiowa religion in a local college program for indigenous teachers , explained to me . " when people are mentally and physically well , it ' s fine , but when we ' re not , the spirit can get to us , because we ' re not protected . a way exists to protect the group , but what happens now is that shamans are not doing the rituals to protect the people – they have inadequate space to do it . to do it you need your proper place . it ' s a sacred thing that can ' t be sung anywhere . " we were sitting in front of his mud - brick house on a reserve on the outskirts of dourados , a city of 215 , 000 people that is the largest in the region . mr . joão gestured briefly with his chin , taking in the jumble of houses down the road and the highway behind us that the government had recently carved through the centre of the reserve . " this is not a sacred place – it ' s not purified . you can ' t do those rituals here . " a few days after i met mr . joão , i went to see a shaman . i drove four hours along that highway , past soy fields that stretched to the horizon , to the guarani - kaiowa reserve at amambai . it ' s a languidly bustling , cheerful community , with a well - built school and playing fields for kids . the town of amambai is about 20 minutes up the road , so a few people go there for work . but the darker side of life here is also apparent : in the middle of the day , you come across women so high on something they can barely walk , leading a pack of filthy half - dressed children down the centre of the road . amambai has been notorious in recent years as the community with the highest suicide rate in brazil , a grim title it lost this year to sassoró . early in the morning , i found ilma gomes , 58 , at home , cooking something in a huge , soot - stained pot over a wood fire in a lean - to . dried gourds doubled as dishes , animal skulls were stashed in the rafters , and mysterious leather bags of things hung on the stick walls ; she was playing guarani ritual music off a thumb drive in a laptop . she wore capri pants and a chiffon shirt ; her silver hair was pulled back in an elegant knot . ilma gomes is a guarani - kaiowa shaman who lives on the reserve in amambai . after 17 people , mostly teenagers , took their own lives in the community in 2015 , she and other traditional healers got together to perform rituals to strengthen the spiritual forces they said could protect the children . she echoed what mr . joão had told me : few people do the rituals any more . there are many rituals a kaiowa must do each day , like taking herbal remedies , to keep the angue away . there are the steps a parent can take if they fear their child is menaced . there is a protective leaf they must use to wash their hair . prayers they must say , to keep safe . but they don ' t . " lots of things now are out of control , " she said , popping up and down from the bench where we sat , to stir the smoking pot . she described how all the youth on the reserve walk around with headphones on , looking at cellphones . " there is a voice speaking right into their heads and they don ' t control what goes in their heads – this takes children into despair , it amplifies sadness , " she said , in guarani . " they fall in love secretly and sometimes start drinking – without the control of the rituals they should be doing .

" studies of indigenous youth in other countries have demonstrated the corrosive effect of " increasing relative disadvantage . " although brazil is currently facing a crisis of unemployment and inflation , real standards of living for most people here improved dramatically in the past 15 years . the poorest brazilians – with the exception of indigenous people – benefited most ; fully 35 million moved out of poverty altogether . almost none of that change reached the reserves . i visited 10 families on reserves in southern mato grosso do sul who lost at least one member to suicide in the preceding year , and the stories the grieving parents told me had many common elements : he fought with his girlfriend . he was angry because i said he could not live with the girl he liked . my daughter was drinking . my son wanted new runners , and i said i could not buy them . " they ' re banal things , " paulo fiel , the elected leader in sassoró , told me . but the conflict could be enough to startle off the mokoi and gwyra , he said , and leave a soul vulnerable . ms . vick , the head of the mental - health team , said their epidemiological tracking shows that suicide comes in waves , something they are at a loss to explain . mr . izaaque , however , said it makes perfect sense : with no rituals to control the spirits that break loose in jejuvy , and no rituals of protection , the evil spirits wreak havoc on one person , and then the next . in photos : guarani - kaiowa country up closecattle ranching and industrial soy farming have taken over most of the land that was once guarani - kaiowa territory . indigenous people have many land claims in the area registered with the federal government , but these take decades to be adjudicated . residents of the guarani - kaiowa reserve at amambai blocked a nearby highway in november to protest the fact that half the community had been without running water for nearly two months after a pump broke down . protest leaders said that only blocking the highway brings attention from the indigenous affairs organization that manages utilities and other services for the reserve . police separated the protesters from angry white farmers wanting to use the road to get to town . children play in a schoolyard in amambai . guarani - kaiowa youth grow up with access only to poor education . araci samor of amambai lost her husband nivaldo chara martin , 42 , and son michel , 15 , to suicide . a soy field next to the village of jiguarapiru . traditional guarani - kwaiowa land is today the heart of brazil ’ s agro - industry , a booming sector in an otherwise moribund economy . the highly mechanized farms employ few workers , and people on the reserve say white bosses don ’ t like to hire ‘ indios . ’ . suicide ' hot spots , ' but few clear - cut explanationsthe theory that roots the clusters of death by suicide among the guarani - kaiowa in the loss of their land is compelling , and it is cited in virtually all the research or public discussion about the issue . but it raises serious questions . first , why is it only the guarani - kaiowa ? there are seven other indigenous ethnicities in mato grosso do sul , all with similar trajectories of dispossession , yet only this one has a suicide crisis . eighty per cent of indigenous suicides take place in four " hot spots , " which are home to 40 per cent of the indigenous population . the first is mato grosso do sul ; the other three are in the amazon rain forest , among ethnicities that have dramatically different experiences from the guarani - kaiowa – they have not been driven off their land , they continue to practise traditional agriculture and hunting and handicrafts , and in many cases they are the dominant ethnicity in their towns . two of the amazonian communities share some features : they are in remote areas near borders with colombia and peru – where the federal government has made a push in recent years to increase urbanization and establish a brazilian ( that is , non - indigenous ) presence . there is a large military installation in each , and a growing influence of drug traffickers . but the fourth of the " suicide hot spots " is in a state to the north , in its largest city , with nothing in common with the other areas . " the question of demarcation of land is an interesting lens to look at the suicides in mato grosso do sul , " said maximiliano ponte de souza , a psychiatrist based in the amazonian city of manaus who is one of the leading ( and , he points out dryly , one of the only ) medical experts on indigenous suicide . " but that doesn ' t apply to the amazon , which is where the largest indigenous territories in brazil have been demarcated . " most of the rain - forest communities share one feature : starting in the 1950s , children about nine or 10 years old were taken from their families to live in a network of religious boarding schools run by salesian catholic priests , in an initiative enthusiastically endorsed by the federal government . the schools had a rigorous schedule that combined studying in portuguese ( indigenous languages were forbidden ) and manual work on farms . there have not been reports in brazil of widespread sexual abuse in the schools , but then there has been no public accounting of the residential - school experience . dr . ponte de souza says children were taken young – because that was viewed as the best way to break the cycle of passing on their community ' s spiritual beliefs – and in the process , missed the rituals for the process of becoming adults . the last of the schools was closed in 1986 . the loss of rituals features in a number of anthropology journals , but this is not a clear - cut explanation either : each of the three amazonian hot spots is home to a number of ethnic groups , but as with the guarani - kaiowa , only one such group , in each place , has a suicide crisis . in this , the brazilian situation mirrors canada ' s : there are canadian indigenous communities with epidemics of suicide , such as northern saskatchewan ; and attawapiskat in northern ontario , where more than 100 people tried to kill themselves in the past year . but there are also indigenous canadian communities where the suicide rate is lower than the national one . in a single geographic region , different first nations have a marked difference in suicide rates – the james bay and northern quebec land claim , for example , covers both cree and inuit ; only the inuit have elevated rates of suicide . suicide in canada is often connected with the residential - school experience , yet the largely catholic communities that surround the former residential school at chesterfield inlet in nunavut have some of the lowest suicide rates in the territory . in canada , there is research under way to try to understand why suicide occurs within some but not other groups with highly similar socioeconomic environments and experiences of colonialism . in brazil , dr . ponte de souza works out of a closet - sized office stuffed with what passes for an archive and struggles to scrape together funds to allow a graduate student or two to do field work based on interviews with a dozen people . in mato grosso do sul , i asked everyone i met why they thought the guarani - kaiowa are plagued by suicide , when other first nations living on the surrounding land are not . edemilson canale , the head of indigenous health services , said the guarani - kaiowa reserves are closest to the cities – giving people a sense of what they lack – but also located in the part of the state with the fewest employment possibilities . as a people , they were traditionally semi - nomadic , whereas the people of the terena ethnicity , for example , always farmed , making the " internment " harder for the guarani - kaiowa . his colleague , the psychologist fabiane vick , said her staff reports that the guarani - kaiowa are " much more introspective and reserved than other ethnicities … our professionals find it very difficult – they don ' t share their emotions or suffering . it ' s locked away , even with their own people . " but dr . ponte de souza said this line of explanation makes him uneasy . " people seek answers in the sociocultural organization of each group and their differences . ' the terena are more open in incorporating the new , unlike the guarani - kaiowa ' – that kind of thing . this … places the blame for the suicide on the victim , " he said . " i ask , ' is suicide perhaps a social strategy for diminishing suffering ? ' if i say ' their culture is the cause , ' i forget all the suffering that the community endured . " in every conversation about suicide he has ever had with indigenous people of every ethnicity , he said , it is clear that they see it as a " bad death , " not desirable – so it is difficult to believe there is anything inherent in the people or their culture that makes suicide an acceptable choice , he added . no warning signs – and no one looking to helpin sassoró , i found maria benites sitting in a broken bamboo chair in the dirt patch between the two lean - tos where she and her grandchildren have been sleeping . they moved here from another house after gilmar killed himself in october – most families choose not to stay in a house where jejuvy has happened . she got up and brought out a small , rickety bench for me to sit on – the best piece of furniture for a visitor . the combined material possessions of ms . benites and the two children and four grandchildren who live with her would fit in a laundry basket . nilcilene , 10 , and vera lucia , 5 , listen while their grandmother maria benites talks about two of her sons , who died by suicide in the past year and a half . she said there was no warning sign that either of her boys was considering suicide . junior , she said , was angry that she didn ' t want him to go to an all - night dance party with a friend she believed was a drug user . and when gilmar died , 10 months later – he missed his brother , and he was squabbling with his pregnant wife . but she believes someone may have been envious of her good - looking , healthy sons , and put a spell on them . that , she believes , could unlock angue as well . and that makes her fear for the grandchildren . " i think every day they might take the same path , " she said . " i need to find out who cast the spell , so they can ' t do the same to the others . " but the loss of both these boys , in just a year , has left ms . benites bone - achingly weary , with a sparseness to her movements and an even greater economy of words . thoughts of those boys catch her mind and draw her away for long stretches , when she sits and stares into the middle distance . one thing ms . benites did not tell me , something i learned later from the reserve leader , paulo fiel : junior benites had tried twice before to kill himself . no one in the family sought help , at the time , or later . none came to them . dr . ponte de souza told me he hears variations of this in many of the verbal autopsies he does with the families of suicide victims in the amazon . " in addition to saying that the people were ' normal ' and ' fine , ' family members also said that the person who died by suicide had already attempted suicide other times , " he said . " in other societies , this situation would be considered very alarming and not at all ' normal . ' " but the terrible frequency of suicide has served to normalize it . " and although people have attempted suicide various times , they haven ' t sought help , either from the indigenous health agents or from traditional sources . " and although the deaths were recorded as suicide , help has not sought them , either . on the reserve in amambai , i met claudinéia rodrigues and fernando sarmori , who agreed to talk to me about their son , allen . we settled together in the yard , as their daughters – a six - year - old with a grimy barbie ; an aloof 16 - year - old – swung in a hammock in the yard . allen was 16 , in his first year of high school and thinking about a career in the military when he was found hanged in a tree near their home a year ago . ms . rodrigues sobbed and rocked from side to side , tipping forward so that her dark hair tumbled over to hide her face , saying she was sure someone had a hand in her son ' s death , then telling me that he had her cellphone and was wearing a new shirt she had bought him , on the day he died – words that sounded almost defensive , because the neighbours had told me allen was angry at his parents that he couldn ' t buy a phone or new clothes . " why did they take the life of my son ? " she asked , and wept , and the " they " seemed as if it encompassed all who wished her ill , human and otherwise . mr . sarmori , a tall , thin man , stood behind his wife raking distractedly at the dirt , and told me allen wasn ' t the first , far from it : his father and his sister both hanged themselves . so did ms . rodrigues ' s brother . and yet , despite this , allen ' s parents said that i was the first person to come to their home to ask about him and what was happening when he died . the first to ask about any of the suicides in the family . no mental - health professional has come , no one from the medical service or the reserve leadership , ms . rodrigues said . i heard this in every one of the homes i visited : no one has come . no one has asked . a jarring encounterthe psychologist who covers this region is an earnest white woman named monay larissa de souza , who is 29 . for six years , she served the community – whose language she does not speak – alone , even as the number of youth suicides rose steadily . last year , two more psychologists were added to her team . now they are attempting to visit every home where someone takes his or her own life , in order to identify and try to track family members , she said – because they have learned that when there is one , there will usually be more . in sassoró , the psychologist assigned to the area is one of the few indigenous professionals in the health service , a guarani - kaiowa woman named barbara rodrigues . ( she doesn ' t speak the language either , because her mother , determined that she would get a good education , put her in a " white " school where she learned portuguese . ) she has been in the job a year , and says if she had known what it would entail , she might not have taken it . she hears stories of abuse , but says she has no way to intervene ; stories of people in the community selling alcohol to minors , but can do nothing about it . " it ' s a very frustrating job , i won ' t deny it , " she said , in a late - night conversation on the porch of her home in tacuru , the town near the reserve . " i identify risks and tell the rest of the services , and nothing happens . i ' m here to collect statistics – there ' s nothing else i can do . " in her lap , she held a pink , glitter - spackled folder of her case notes : interviews with family members and friends of the young people who killed themselves in sassoró this year . each one was a litany of misery – of alcoholism , domestic abuse , unemployment , hunger for opportunities that didn ' t come . but the reasons family members give for suicides – " they ' re just trivial things . " it leaves her mystified . " if i could say that ' s the thing that ' s causing it – fantastic , we ' ll go there and tackle it . but i can ' t say . " ms . rodrigues ' s concern was palpable , but i did not find it echoed everywhere . on the reserve in dourados , i had a jarring encounter with the mental - health services . i drove up to the administration office and met the community leader . when i told him i was reporting on suicide , he replied , " we had one yesterday ! or maybe it was two days ago . " he summoned the psychologist on staff , elizeti moreira , and told her why i ' d come . ms . moreira is terena , the only other indigenous psychologist working in the region . she reached into her pocket and drew out her mobile phone , thrusting it toward me to display a picture . " he had been in to see me just two days before , and when i heard the news , i rushed right there to see if it was the same guy . and it was ! hanging here . " she laughed in apparent amazement and shook her head . in the photo on her screen , a man in blue shorts hung from a mango tree , his neck crooked sharply to the left . psychologist elizeti moreira looks out the window of the health centre on the dourados reserve . she led me to her office and read me her case notes from her meeting with onildo de oliveira . he was a father of four , unemployed and deeply troubled about his inability to find work . his former wife had had him detained for failure to pay child support once before , and he didn ' t want to return to jail . the children asked him for food , and he had nothing to give them . he went to apply whenever he heard about jobs , but the people hiring made clear those jobs weren ' t for índios . ms . moreira put his file down and repeated that she had had no hint he might be suicidal . i asked her what she would have done had she suspected he might be . she told me how , a year earlier , a woman of about the same age had come to see her , similarly desperate about how to feed her family . ms . moreira had got her a job washing clothes with a white friend in town , " and then she was fine . " but with mr . oliveira ? " because he ' s a man , there ' s nothing i could do . " i asked if i might be able to meet his family , and the leader told a reluctant ms . moreira to show me the way . as we drove up , through a thicket of trees , she pointed out the one where he had killed himself . his mother , celestina vilhalva , 58 , tiny , hunched , with a weathered face , was crocheting on a bench outside the two - room house , but began to sob when we said we had come to ask about mr . oliveira ; his former wife , mara de souza , 33 , had a dazed expression on her face . they told me that he was a good man , who went to church , and didn ' t drink , and they had had no warning . ms . moreira , the psychologist , interrupted to bring up the cycle of suicides that could be set off now . ms . de souza shuddered . " i don ' t know what this means for my daughter , " she said . while we talked , five - year - old lara ran back and forth in the yard , chasing geese into the tall grass , slowing a little , from time to time , to see if her mother and grandmother still wept . left : alisson ortis and nicole samoiri martin , both eight years old , play in a tree in their yard in amambai . nicole lost her father and brother to suicide . right : the da silva siblings miguel , 4 , bruna , 6 , and neto , 8 , in the village of jaguapiru on the reserve in dourados . child mortality in their community is more than double brazil ’ s national rate . ' valuing life , ' identifying riskdiscussion about the causes of indigenous suicide in canada often focus on the loss of language and cultural identity , and on how young people feel a lack of opportunities for their future . there is broad consensus that these are factors , although they raise the same questions – why some communities with these problems have high rates of suicide and others do not . inuit communities have the highest suicide rates in canada , but in most cases they have the highest levels , among all indigenous peoples , of geographical , language and cultural continuity . some of the newer research in canada looks at intergenerational trauma – at the impact on the young people whose parents and grandparents were coerced into relocation , or abused at residential schools , for example . there is a focus on adversity in early childhood , and how it can play into suicide risk : there is strong evidence to suggest that children who are exposed to " adverse environments " – to alcoholism and drug use , to domestic violence , to sexual abuse even if they are not its direct victim – will develop impulse - control problems and have trouble understanding the consequences of their actions . it ' s a description that fits every one of the cases in barbara rodrigues ' s pink folder . but none of the mental - health workers in mato grosso do sul had ever heard about this research . at the end of 2015 , with 17 suicides in amambai , fabiane vick and her team began to implement the government ' s new suicide - prevention program there . it was the first organized effort in the indigenous health service to address suicide , even though it was the leading cause of death for people under 30 . they got better vehicles , so they could travel to more parts of the reserves , and added to the staff . " we did activities on ' valuing life ' – talking about plans , dreams , goals , self - esteem – with the help of indigenous health agents in communities , " ms . vick said . they held meetings for pastors , leaders , and others in the community called upon to interact with the reserve , such as police and paramedics – and talked to them about identifying suicide risk , and prevention strategies . last year , there were just four suicides in amambai . ms . vick and her team are understandably delighted . but the federal government did not make any provision for research to evaluate the impact of the intervention , or to compare the outcome to communities that do not receive it , so they have to base their plans on their faith that it is working . there was one suicide in amambai in january , of a 26 - year - old ; there were none in february . meanwhile , when i was in amambai , i learned that there was another suicide intervention under way , another possible explanation for the decline in deaths . ilma gomes , the shaman , told me that last year , after so many children took their own lives , she and the other traditional healers got together and decided they needed to take action . clearly these children lacked the forces that would shelter the mokoi and the gwyra , would keep them in place as the guardians against evil spirits . so the healers began to do the rituals of protection , all of them together , at once , every day – in the schools and all the places where young people gather . " we did it for three months . and then the dying stopped . " arsenio vasques , 63 , raised his grandson enildo from the time he was a baby . enildo hanged himself last year , at 16 . mr . vasques has been trying to address the rash of youth suicides in amambai , where he is a community leader – but said he never expected the menace they call jejuvy would touch his own family . ‘to fight these suicides , it can ’ t just be the leaders , it has to be all of us together , teachers , pastors , we all have to be united . ’ stephanie nolen is the globe and mail ' s latin america correspondent . follow her on twitter : @snolenwith research from elisângela mendonçamore from the globe and mailnatan obed : indigenous suicide is no longer a mystery . so why the continued political apathy ? prevention requires an understanding of how social , political and health inequities negatively influence the environments in which children grow up , explains the president of inuit tapiriit kanatami . ’ my cry for help could have been lethal ’ : an mla ’ s message for indigenous youth in distress 2 : 07
__label__no_relevant latin america ' s indigenous shield elderly from coronavirus elderly people at high risk from covid - 19 are seen as the main cultural guardians of many indigenous traditions and languagescoronavirus is changing the world in unprecedented ways . subscribe here for a daily briefing on how this global crisis is affecting cities , technology , approaches to climate change , and the lives of vulnerable people . by cassandra garrison , marina lammertyn and anthony boadlebuenos aires / brasilia , may 11 ( reuters ) - indigenous peoples across latin america are cutting off their communities from the outside world , worried that the coronavirus could pose a grave threat to their culture by putting at risk tribal elders , the keepers of their heritage . from the rocky patagonian regions of argentina to the lush brazilian amazon and the andean villages of colombia , indigenous groups are barricading villages against outsiders and doling out harsh punishment to members who violate quarantine rules . latin america is home to 42 million indigenous people , making up about 8% of the population , according to world bank data , yet their way of life is already threatened by rapid development in mining , oil extraction and deforestation . the virus represents a new , and potentially catastrophic , risk . the elderly - the group most vulnerable to complications from covid - 19 - are the guardians of many traditions and languages threatened with extinction . " the fundamental importance of elders is that they hold the collective memory , particularly regarding our identity , " said eduardo nieva , a community leader for the amaicha de valle indigenous group in northwest argentina . coronavirus : our latest storiesbecause latin america ' s indigenous populations are often preliterate , their history may not be written : it is passed down the generations by elders through storytelling . " all indigenous wisdom is oral , passed from generation to generation , so the elders carry all the accumulated experience , " nieva said . " that experience - the one they keep - is what we are protecting . " in the amazon , on brazil ' s oldest indigenous reservation , the xingu , guidance from elders is key to performing the kuarup dance ritual that brings together the community ' s 16 tribes each year to celebrate life , death and rebirth . " we are very worried . if we lose our elders we will lose their knowledge not just of cultural traditions and religious rituals , but of our traditional medicine , " said jair kuikuro , 32 , a filmmaker who documents indigenous life in the amazon . his grandmother is a custodian of a sacred chant for a women - only fertility ritual called the yamurikuma . " if she gets the virus , if she goes , her song will be lost without trace , " said kuikuro . the rural parts of latin america are among the last places on the planet to be affected by the coronavirus , and testing in these remote areas is limited , but official figures suggest the virus is beginning to spread there . communities are taking special precautions to make sure older members have food and supplies without needing to venture beyond their territories , several indigenous leaders said . vulnerable to new infectionsthe continent ' s indigenous groups , some of which only number in the hundreds , are particularly vulnerable to new infectious diseases , said carolyn stephens , a professor of global health at university college london who has worked with indigenous communities around the world . stephens cited the first wave of european colonization in latin america that introduced diseases like smallpox - resulting in millions of deaths among native populations - as an example of what could happen with a new virus . in argentina , home to at least 35 officially recognized indigenous communities , fears for the elderly have led some groups to take extreme measures to insulate themselves from outsiders . in northern argentina ' s tucuman and salta provinces , some communities have barricaded roads leading to their villages , said relmu ñamku , a mapuche leader . in other cases , community guards - who previously policed drug trafficking and other crime - have been deployed to keep away outsiders . in the xingu in brazil , locals remember how nearly half the inhabitants of a village of the kalapalo tribe were wiped out by measles in the 1950s . roads into the park have been blocked and no outsiders other than medical personnel are allowed in . in colombia ' s narino province , which borders ecuador , members of the pasto indigenous community strictly enforce quarantine rules , using corporal punishment for rule breakers . a cellphone video from april on local media showed a young man who a community leader said had violated quarantine writhing in agony after receiving three lashes from a cow hide whip . pasto leader pablo taimal confirmed the video ' s veracity . " indigenous guards have been ordered to do what is necessary to safeguard the health and integrity of our communities , " said taimal . he said they feared people crossing from ecuador , where the coronavirus has overwhelmed the health system . indigenous people said community elders often held the knowledge about centuries - old traditional medicines such as yacon , a root known for antioxidant benefits . " as a mapuche , if we take our known medicines , we will heal , " said estela astorga porma , 77 , a mapuche woman in chile ' s southern region of biobio . the effectiveness of indigenous medicines to treat diseases like covid - 19 has not been proven . it is also common tradition for younger people to go to the homes of elders to seek guidance in making decisions , community members said , a practice now on hold out of caution . " grandmothers are the community counselors . older people are those who transmit ancestral wisdom , those who organize us , give order , advise spiritually , " said rosa ñancucheo , 61 , a mapuche woman from chubut province in southern argentina . " today , we meet less than before .

( cbc ) in addition , the francophone culture adds its colours to the beautiful multicultural landscape of the province . further , n . l . has been home to chinese , lebanese and jewish immigrants who arrived in the late 19th century , more than a hundred years ago . currently , 15 , 755 immigrants coming from different parts of the globe reside in this province . however , the roster of candidates fails to reflect the breadth of this diversity . that has a direct bearing on how we are governed . policies – implemented through a set of procedures — shape and inform the blueprint of the culture , values , decisions and actions that any governance stands for . from our grassroot organizations to the highest echelons in this province , policies play a vital role in constructing a narrative that influences the present and foretells the future . who ' s not in high office ? today ' s climate , where our policies and procedures have an ethnocentric view attempting to be " inclusive " to anything that isn ' t the prescribed norm , is a result of the lack of diverse perspectives in the highest offices in our province . for transformative policy - making to take place , the table ( around which decisions of today that affect tomorrow are made ) needs to have a wide range of voices . however , a word of caution : having diverse perspectives is only the first step . to avoid tokenism , it is imperative to understand that diversity is merely the ticket to a table and inclusion the voice at that table . pluralism is the active engagement of the plethora of voices around that table and can be achieved by providing equitable opportunities to those at the table and by recognizing their contributions . policy aside , philosophically , seeing persons of colour — i prefer the phrase " melanin - rich " — in elected office sets a precedent for individuals who identify with that demographic , empowering them to , hopefully , participate actively in politics . for the mainstream culture , it creates an opportunity to view a demographic differently ( perhaps even shattering any stereotypes along the way ) . barriers are systemiclast week , the gender and politics laboratory at the department of political science at memorial university held a path - breaking conference called gauging women ' s presence in municipal politics : newfoundland and labrador . interesting discussion aside , it provided an insight into the makings of a political figure in our province . focusing on community development and finding a mentor were pointed out to be major plusses while navigating a political career . but for melanin - rich demographics ( especially immigrants ) , this poses to be a problem to be actively engaged in politics . to avoid tokenism , it is imperative to understand that diversity is merely the ticket to a table and inclusion the voice at that table - sourcefor many , in addition to financial limitations required to run a successful campaign , the heavy reliance on informal social networks to find funding and mentoring coupled with the loss of a social network and language barriers only exacerbate the impediments to a long , winding political path . inherent and systemic biases and prejudice make this journey more arduous and cumbersome , eventually , influencing who occupies a seat in the house of assembly . specifically , for immigrants , the transition to citizenship is a time - consuming and mentally and economically stressful process . without citizenship , an individual cannot run for any elected office ( and hence , cannot constructively effect change ) . easing ways to transition from a worker / student / refugee to a citizen – not only by time , but also through cost – would , possibly , catalyze the engagement of these new voices . immigrants are eager to share their wealth of knowledge and diverse perspectives in the political sphere . unsure who ' d fit the bill ? just start by asking – ask an immigrant , a melanin - rich individual you know if they ' d run for office . you ' d be surprised to find how much they ' re willing to contribute and serve the place they lovingly call home . the political dna of newfoundland and labrador needs altering , and it is only possible if we pay heed to the voices that are , perhaps , seldom heard or seen . what would make prajwala dixit smile ? a more diverse set of politicians on the other side of the wall at confederation building : that is , the house of assembly .

__label__no_relevant here ’ s who lost jobs in the pandemic , and who needs support the covid - 19 crisis has caused unprecedented job losses across canada , and b . c . has not been spared . between february and may almost 590 , 000 b . c . workers lost their jobs or more than half their hours — 23 per cent of all workers employed in february . despite a slight recovery of jobs in may and june , the scale of job losses and disruptions far exceed those seen in typical recessions . announcements , events & more from tyee and select partners this fall , an invitation to fight loneliness in your community in september , people all over bc are meeting to talk about what ’ s on their minds . you should join them . while all sectors of the economy have been affected , the labour market hit has worsened existing inequalities . lower - paid workers in part - time , temporary and more precarious jobs were much more likely to lose their jobs or the majority of their hours than those in higher - paid , more secure jobs . younger workers , recent immigrants , women — particularly mothers of younger children — and workers who lack the protection of a union were hardest hit . understanding the highly unequal impacts of the current crisis on b . c . workers is crucial in designing effective and equitable solutions as we look to rebuild the provincial economy . public investments in the recovery must promote job creation in sectors and positions that employ the types of workers who suffered the worst labour market impacts . this will require significant investments in programs that enable all british columbians to fully participate in the economy by expanding access to affordable , safe child care and seniors care , and by enabling unemployed and underemployed workers to access low - cost skill development opportunities . the following eight charts show just how unequal the jobs impacts of the pandemic have been in b . c . 1 . low - wage workers were significantly more likely to lose their jobs or the majority of their hours . the job losses and cuts in hours resulting from the pandemic have been felt across the income ladder . however , they have been far more severe for lower - wage workers . half of b . c . workers who earned minimum wage or slightly above ( the bottom wage 10 per cent ) lost their jobs or hours , compared to fewer than one in 10 among higher - paid workers ( $29 to $48 per hour ) . half of all b . c . ’ s job losses were concentrated in the lowest - paid 20 per cent of workers ( under $17 per hour ) . these workers are disproportionately women , racialized and indigenous and recent immigrants . only four per cent of bc ’ s total job losses were shouldered by those in the top 40 per cent of the wage distribution ( earning over $29 per hour ) . the heavy impact on workers at the lower end of the income ladder isn ’ t surprising given the industries most disrupted by the pandemic . three - quarters of those who lost their jobs between february and may were employed in one of five industries : accommodation and food services , retail , construction , information , culture and recreation and a sector called “ other services , ” which includes personal services , repair and maintenance , domestic workers ( including nannies , cleaners and gardeners ) and most charities and non - profits . in addition , 43 per cent of the b . c . workers who lost the majority of their hours between february and may worked in one of these five industries . 2 . non - unionized workers were much harder hit . more than a quarter of non - unionized workers lost their jobs or the majority of their hours compared to only eight per cent of unionized workers . unionized workers were also much more likely to see reductions in hours than outright job losses . this is hardly surprising since unionization and collective bargaining tends to offer better workplace protections , and the hardest - hit sectors have lower unionization rates . expanding access to unionization for lower - paid , precarious workers could improve job security and protections to b . c . ’ s most vulnerable workers and should be a key plank of the recovery . 3 . young workers , particularly young women , saw staggering job losses . workers under 25 in b . c . were three times as likely as workers aged 25 to 54 to suffer job losses , with one in three young worker jobs ( 34 per cent ) evaporating between february and may . however , the average job loss among youth hides enormous gender differences . young women under 25 experienced by far the worst job losses with a 41 - per - cent drop in employment compared to 27 per cent for their male peers . the covid - 19 recession has been dubbed a she - cession because women were much more likely than men to lose their job in march . while layoffs among men caught up in april , men have seen a faster jobs recovery in may . in b . c . , women saw a 16 - per - cent decline in employment between february and may compared to a decline of 12 per cent for men . further , women were more likely to lose their jobs , whereas men were more likely to have the majority of their hours cut while remaining employed . this difference was particularly pronounced among younger workers . 4 . one in three recent immigrants lost their job . among recent immigrants in b . c . — those who have had permanent resident status in canada for less than 10 years—the magnitude of job losses was nearly three times as high as those experienced by more established immigrants and non - immigrants . immigrant women were more likely to lose their jobs than immigrant men , who were more likely to experience cuts in their hours but keep their jobs . 5 . mothers saw significantly larger job losses than fathers , especially those with young children . school and child - care closures during the pandemic have imposed additional challenges for workers with children . among working parents 25 to 54 , those with children under six were much more likely to experience losses in jobs and hours — mothers in particular . ( working parents make up about 43 per cent of the total b . c . workforce aged 25 to 54 . ) although the government introduced job - protected unpaid leave for parents who needed to care for their children while schools and child - care providers were closed , a significant share of mothers with children under six working in february appear to have lost their jobs ( 16 per cent ) . in addition , parents of younger children were more likely to have lost the majority of their hours than their peers . going into the pandemic , women in b . c . already had a lower workforce participation rate than men and the gap was largest for women with children under six due to the lack of access to quality , affordable child care in our province . prioritizing safe and accessible child care for working parents over the summer and fall is essential if we are going to rebuild the province ’ s economy and ensure young families can weather the recession . 6 . single parents with young children were even harder hit . half of b . c . ’ s working single parents with children under six lost their jobs or hours . this group was small to begin with due to lack of affordable child - care spaces . not surprisingly , single parents were much more likely to experience job losses than those in two - parent families where child care responsibilities can be shared . children in single - parent families are already at much higher risk of poverty than their peers in two - parent families , and the gap is likely to grow unless b . c . makes significant investments in expanding access to safe , affordable child care . even if most of b . c . ’ s unemployed single parents are receiving the cerb for now , it is not at all clear that they will qualify for employment insurance once cerb is phased out in the fall . even if they do , their benefits may be too low to keep them out of poverty . 7 . workers in small businesses were more likely to lose their jobs . when a pandemic hits , working moms pay the price read morenearly half of all b . c . job losses between february and may were concentrated among those working for small employers ( fewer than 20 staff ) , even though only 20 per cent of workers were employed by a small business . this is hardly surprising . small businesses and non - profit employers are less likely to have operational reserves to absorb the costs of pandemic closures or slowdowns — even with wage subsidies — and have been forced to lay off more of their workers than large corporations . not included in the chart above are self - employed workers . about half of b . c . ’ s self - employed workers are unincorporated and have no employees . this group reported very high losses in hours , with more than one in three losing the majority of their hours . it is critically important to continue monitoring the jobs recovery for this particularly vulnerable group of workers as the cerb is phased out , because they will not qualify for existing employment insurance programs . 8 . indigenous men are more likely to have lost jobs . statistics about job loss among indigenous workers are only available in the form of three - month moving averages , and there ’ s no data on reduced hours . but comparing the average employment numbers for march , april and may with those from december , january and february can help us pinpoint which groups and regions were hit harder by the job market losses , although these numbers should be viewed with some caution . indigenous workers were slightly more likely to lose their jobs than non - indigenous workers in b . c . , particularly indigenous men . indigenous and non - indigenous women experienced similar rates of job loss , higher than non - indigenous men . 
__label__no_relevant in canada , a metoo reckoning is still leaving marginalized communities behind bloc québécois leader yves - françois blanchet told reporters he “ unequivocally denies ” allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in the 1990s . photo by justin tang / the canadian pressthe first image on each post is a warning : here is a detailed account of sexual assault , or rape , or abuse , or coercion , or any other of the myriad forms that sexual violence can take . there are dozens of posts—and more go up every day . these often harrowing , mainly anonymous testimonials have appeared on instagram accounts across quebec over the past several weeks , as a groundswell of anger and frustration has erupted over a lack of justice and support for survivors of sexual violence in the province , and pushed hundreds of people into the streets of montreal and quebec city on july 19 to demand action . the posts have also led to backlash , as some of quebec ’ s most well - known public figures , from tattoo artists , actors , musicians , and artists , to politicians and the heads of major companies , have been accused of inappropriate behaviour . quebec actress maripier morin publicly apologized after singer - songwriter safia nolin said morin bit her on the thigh and sexually harassed her in a montreal bar . singer kevin parent , maybe watson , a member of quebec hip hop group alaclair ensemble , and simple plan bassist david desrosiers all apologized after sexual misconduct accusations surfaced . bloc québécois leader yves - françois blanchet told reporters he “ unequivocally denies ” allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in the 1990s , when he worked as quebec singer eric lapointe ’ s manager . several top executives at montreal video game company ubisoft have also resigned after allegations of sexual harassment and a toxic workplace . even though many sexual violence survivors are speaking out publicly , it remains especially difficult for survivors from marginalized communities to have their voices heard . tarah paul , a project manager at west island calacs , an organization just west of montreal that works to prevent sexual assault , said all sexual assault survivors struggle to be believed , but it is even harder for black , indigenous , and other women of colour , as well as for people with disabilities and members of the lgbtq community , to be taken seriously . “ they tend to be hyper - sexualized , stereotyped , and sometimes ( people ) tend to question if what they say is true , ” she said , adding that even if they are believed , they often don ' t have access to help that is inclusive or safe . “ as community organizers and organizations we should listen and be ready to adapt our services and be more open to their realities , ” paul said . jessica quijano , coordinator of the iskweu project at the native women ’ s shelter of montreal , said for some sexual assault survivors , including the indigenous women she works with who are homeless , calling the police often is not an option . “ if you ’ re someone who ’ s marginalized or living on the street , calling the police for your protection isn ’ t something you do . ” montreal police have been accused of racially profiling and harassing indigenous women , while indigenous women in val d ’ or , 500 kilometres north of montreal , came forward in 2015 to decry abuse at the hands of provincial police officers over many years . those allegations led to a provincial inquiry that concluded last year that first nations and inuit are subjected to “ systemic discrimination ” in quebec ’ s public services . “ if you ’ re someone who ’ s marginalized or living on the street , calling the police for your protection isn ’ t something you do—especially if they ’ re often criminalizing you , ” quijano told vice in an interview . the native women ’ s shelter is one of several organizations in montreal that has called for the city to cut its police budget by 50 percent and reinvest that money into community programs , including ones to stop sexual violence . quijano said boosting access to housing and education and providing culturally appropriate trauma services would help address the problem , as would implementing the recommendations of the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls . “ if we put those things into action , we would really see a drastic reduction in not only sexual assaults , but women going missing , being murdered , suicide , ” quijano said . “ it ’ s all interlinked . ” marlihan lopez , coordinator at the simone de beauvoir institute at concordia university , said seeing survivors of sexual violence break their silence on social media right now highlights the failures of the justice system . “ it just demonstrates the fatigue and the frustration with the systems that are offered to us … ( that ) do not respond to the needs or the realities of survivors of sexual violence , ” she told vice news . lopez said many survivors still do not have adequate access to services in quebec , while much of what is available is not tailored to and excludes black , indigenous or trans communities . she said she welcomed vancouver ’ s decision last year , for example , to cut funding to a rape crisis centre that would not accept trans people . “ we need to see more of this , ” lopez said . “ they ’ re receiving money and there ’ s no reason why there should be communities that are excluded by their services . ” she also pointed to the fact that she and other community organizers have spent years advocating for more support for sexual assault survivors in montreal north , but they are still waiting . the neighbourhood has a large racialized and immigrant population—over two - thirds of its 84 , 000 - plus residents in 2016 were born outside of canada or had at least one parent who was—and one in six residents there in 2015 made less than $20 , 000 a year . the government needs to invest in programs “ by and for these communities , ” said lopez , and organizations that work on issues of sexual violence also need to be held accountable if marginalized people are excluded from their services . “ we ’ re inviting survivors to disclose , we ’ re inviting survivors to break ( their ) silence , but afterwards , what are we offering survivors in terms of resources and services ? ” she said . “ we need to move forward and ensure that we ’ re addressing this issue in a systemic manner and also holding space for survivors and offering them a path for healing . ”

__label__no_relevant our parents , the russian spies | the world weekly our parents , the russian spies | the world weeklytim foley turned 20 on 27 june 2010 . to celebrate , his parents took him and his younger brother alex out for lunch at an indian restaurant not far from their home in cambridge , massachusetts . both brothers were born in canada , but for the past decade the family had lived in the us . the boys ’ father , donald heathfield , had studied in paris and at harvard , and now had a senior role at a consultancy firm based in boston . their mother , tracey foley , had spent many years focused on raising her children , before taking a job as a real estate agent . to those who knew them , they seemed a very ordinary american family , albeit with canadian roots and a penchant for foreign travel . both brothers were fascinated by asia , a favoured holiday destination , and the parents encouraged their sons to be inquisitive about the world : alex was only 16 , but had just returned from a six - month student exchange in singapore . after a buffet lunch , the four returned home and opened a bottle of champagne to toast tim reaching his third decade . the brothers were tired ; they had thrown a small house party the night before to mark alex ’ s return from singapore , and tim planned to go out later . after the champagne , he went upstairs to message his friends about the evening ’ s plans . there came a knock at the door , and tim ’ s mother called up that his friends must have come early , as a surprise . at the door , she was met by a different kind of surprise altogether : a team of armed , black - clad men holding a battering ram . they streamed into the house , screaming , “ fbi ! ” another team entered from the back ; men dashed up the stairs , shouting at everyone to put their hands in the air . upstairs , tim had heard the knock and the shouting , and his first thought was that the police could be after him for underage drinking : nobody at the party the night before had been 21 , and boston police took alcohol regulations seriously . when he emerged on to the landing , it became clear the fbi was here for something far more serious . the two brothers watched , stunned , as their parents were put in handcuffs and driven away in separate black cars . tim and alex were left behind with a number of agents , who said they needed to begin a 24 - hour forensic search of the home ; they had prepared a hotel room for the brothers . one of the men told them their parents had been arrested on suspicion of being “ unlawful agents of a foreign government ” . alex presumed there had been some mistake – the wrong house , or a mix - up over his father ’ s consultancy work . donald travelled frequently for his job ; perhaps this had been confused with espionage . at worst , perhaps he had been tricked by an international client . even when the brothers heard on the radio a few days later that 10 russian spies had been rounded up across the us , in an fbi operation dubbed ghost stories , they remained sure there had been a terrible mistake . but the fbi had not made a mistake , and the truth was so outlandish , it defied comprehension . not only were their parents indeed russian spies , they were russians . the man and woman the boys knew as mom and dad really were their parents , but their names were not donald heathfield and tracey foley . those were canadians who had died long ago , as children ; their identities had been stolen and adopted by the boys ’ parents . their real names were andrei bezrukov and elena vavilova . they were both born in the soviet union , had undergone training in the kgb and been dispatched abroad as part of a soviet programme of deep - cover secret agents , known in russia as the “ illegals ” . after a slow - burning career building up an ordinary north american background , the pair were now active agents for the svr , the foreign spy agency of modern russia and a successor to the kgb . they , along with eight other agents , had been betrayed by a russian spy who had defected to the americans . the fbi indictment detailing their misdeeds was a catalogue of espionage cliches : dead drops , brush - pasts , coded messages and plastic bags stuffed with crisp dollar bills . the footage of a plane carrying the 10 touching down at vienna airport , to be swapped for four russians who had been held in russian prisons on charges of spying for the west , brought back memories of the cold war . the media had a field day with the bond - girl looks of 28 - year - old anna chapman , one of two russians arrested not to have pretended to be of western origin ; she worked as an international estate agent in manhattan . russia didn ’ t know whether to be embarrassed or emboldened : its agents had been busted , but what other country would think of mounting such a complex , slow - drip espionage operation in the first place ? for alex and tim , the geopolitics behind the spy swap was the least of their worries . the pair had grown up as ordinary canadians , and now discovered they were the children of russian spies . ahead of them was a long flight to moscow , and an even longer emotional and psychological journey . * * * nearly six years since the fbi raid , i meet alex in a cafe near the kiev railway station in moscow . he is now officially alexander vavilov ; his brother is timofei vavilov , though many of their friends still use their old surname , foley . alex is 21 , his still - boyish looks offset by a serious manner and businesslike clothes : black v - neck over a crisp white shirt . a gentle north american lilt and the careful aspiration of final consonants give him the unplaceable accent of those who have been schooled internationally – in paris , singapore and the us . these days , he speaks enough russian to order lunch , but is by no means fluent . he is studying in a european city and is here to visit his parents ; tim works in finance in asia . ( in the interests of privacy , both brothers have asked me not to reveal details about their working lives . ) since 2010 , they have made a conscious decision to avoid the media . they have agreed to talk to me now , alex explains , because they are fighting a legal battle to win back their canadian citizenship , stripped from them six years ago . they believe it is unfair and illegal that they are expected to answer for the sins of their parents , and have decided to tell their story for the first time . as we eat khachapuri , a georgian bread stuffed with gooey cheese , alex recalls the days after the raid . he and tim stayed up until the early hours in the hotel room the fbi had provided , trying to understand what was going on . when they went home the next day , they found every piece of electronic equipment , every photograph and document had been taken . the fbi ’ s search and seizure warrant lists 191 items removed from the foley / heathfield residence , including computers , mobile phones , photographs and medicines . they even took tim and alex ’ s playstation . news crews held a vigil outside ; the brothers sat inside with the blinds drawn , their phones and computers confiscated . early next morning tim snuck out to get online at the public library and try to find a lawyer for his parents . all the family bank accounts had been frozen , leaving the boys with just the money they had in their pockets and whatever they could borrow from friends . fbi agents drove them to an initial court hearing in boston , where their parents were informed of the charges . there was a brief meeting with their mother inside jail . alex tells me he did not ask her what she and his father were accused of . this seems surprising , i say : surely he must have been dying to ask ? “ here ’ s the thing : i knew that if i was going to testify in court , the less i knew , the better . i didn ’ t want to cloud my opinion with anything . i didn ’ t want to ask questions , because it was obvious people were listening , ” he says . a boisterous group of women are celebrating a birthday at the next table , and he raises his voice . “ i refused to let myself be convinced they were actually guilty of anything , because i realised the case would probably draw on for a long time . they were facing life in prison , and if i was to testify , i would have to completely believe they were innocent . ” the family had been planning a month - long summer break in paris , moscow and turkey ; their mother told them to escape the media circus and fly to russia . after a stopover in paris , alex and tim boarded a plane to moscow , unsure of what to expect on arrival . they had never been to russia before . “ it was a really terrifying moment , ” alex recalls . “ you ’ re sitting on the plane , you have a few hours to kill and you don ’ t know what ’ s coming . you just sit there and think and think . ” as the brothers disembarked , they were met at the plane door by a group of people who introduced themselves in english as colleagues of their parents . they told the brothers to trust them , and led them outside the terminal to a van . “ they showed us photos of our parents in their 20s in uniform , photos of them with medals . that was the moment when i thought , ‘ok , this is real . ’ until that moment , i ’ d refused to believe any of it was true , ” alex says . he and tim were taken to an apartment and told to make themselves at home ; one of their minders spent the next few days showing them around moscow ; they took them to museums , even the ballet . an uncle and a cousin the brothers had no idea existed paid a visit ; a grandmother also dropped by , but she spoke no english and the boys not a word of russian . it would be a few days before their parents would arrive , having admitted at a court hearing in new york on 8 july that they were russian nationals . an exchange was already in the offing , and they arrived in moscow , via vienna , on 9 july , still wearing the orange prison jumpsuits they had been given in america . my face must give away some of my amazement : how does a 16 - year - old process such an extraordinary turn of events ? alex smirks at me wryly . “ typical high school identity crisis , right ? ” alex and tim ’ s father was born andrei olegovich bezrukov , in krasnoyarsk region , in the heart of siberia . since his return to moscow in 2010 , he has given just a handful of interviews to russian media outlets , mainly concerning the more recent work he has done as a geopolitical analyst . details of his past , or that of his wife , elena vavilova , are scarce . alex tells me what he knows about his parents ’ recruitment , based on the little they have told him : “ they got recruited into it together , as a couple . they were promising , young , smart people , they were asked if they wanted to help their country and they said yes . they went through years of training and preparing . ” none of the 10 deportees has spoken publicly about their mission in the us , or their training by the svr or kgb . department s , which runs the illegals programme they were on , was the most secretive part of the kgb . one former “ illegal ” tells me his training in the late 1970s included two years in moscow with daily english lessons , taught by an american woman who had defected . he was also trained in other basics such as communicating in code and surveillance . all the training was done on a one - to - one basis : he never met other agents . the programme was the only one of its kind in international espionage . ( many assumed it had been stopped , until the 2010 fbi swoop . ) many intelligence agencies use agents operating without diplomatic cover ; some have recruited second - generation immigrants already living abroad , but the russians have been the only ones to train agents to pretend to be foreigners . canada was a common place for the illegals to go , to build up their “ legend ” of being an ordinary western citizen before being deployed to target countries , often the us or britain . during soviet times , the illegals had two main functions : to aid in communications between embassy kgb officers and their us sources ( an illegal would be less likely to be put under surveillance than a diplomat ) ; and to be sleeper cells for a potential “ special period ” – a war between the us and the soviet union . the illegals could then spring into action . the kgb sent the couple to canada in the 80s . in june 1990 , vavilova , under the assumed identity of tracey foley , gave birth to tim at the women ’ s college hospital in toronto . his first memories are of attending a french - language school in the city and visiting the warehouse of his dad ’ s company , diapers direct , a nappy delivery service . it was hardly james bond , but the work of an agent has always been more tortoise than hare – years spent painstakingly building up the legend . andrei bezrukov already had a degree from a soviet university , but “ donald heathfield ” had no educational records . between 1992 and 1995 , he studied for a bachelor ’ s degree in international economics at york university in toronto . in 1994 , alex was born ; a year later the family moved to paris . we don ’ t know whether this was on the orders of the svr , but it seems a safe assumption . donald studied for an mba at the école des ponts and the family lived frugally in a small flat not far from the eiffel tower ; both brothers shared the only bedroom while the parents slept on the sofa . as bezrukov and vavilova built up their story , the country that had recruited and trained them ceased to exist . the ideology of communism had failed ; the fearsome spy agency that had dispatched agents across the globe was discredited and renamed . under boris yeltsin , post - soviet russia seemed on the verge of becoming a failed state . but in 1999 , as the family planned a move from france to the us , a new man entered the kremlin who himself had a kgb background . in the subsequent years , he would work to make the kgb ’ s successors important and respected again . with the legend of a hardworking , well - educated canadian perfected over the years , heathfield got into harvard university ’ s kennedy school of government towards the end of that year , and was ready to deploy as an agent of the svr . he would be spying not for the soviet system that had trained him , but for the new russia of vladimir putin . heathfield and foley sent their sons to a bilingual french - english school in boston , so they could maintain their french and stay in touch with european culture . they could not teach their children about russia ; perhaps the emphasis on french was a way of ensuring their children were not “ ordinary ” americans without ringing alarm bells . at home , the family spoke a mixture of english and french . ( an online video of bezrukov , appearing in his post - deportation role as a political analyst , shows him speaking smooth north american with the faintest of twangs . ) when he completed his postgraduate degree at harvard , heathfield got a job working for global partners , a business development consultancy . i speak to tim on a sunday afternoon , talking to me on skype from his kitchen . he has the same facial features and careful parting as his younger brother , but his hair is blond rather than dark . looking back on his youth , he tells me his father worked hard , making frequent business trips . he encouraged his sons to read and educate themselves about the world , and “ was like a best friend to us ” . foley , tim says , was a “ soccer mom ” , picking her sons up from school and taking them to sports practice . when the boys were in their teens , she started work as a real estate agent . in 2008 , tim got a place at george washington university , in dc , to study international relations . he focused on asia , taking mandarin lessons and spending a semester in beijing . the same year , the family became naturalised americans , with us passports in addition to their canadian nationality . the brothers would never live in canada again ; alex had been one when they left toronto and tim only five – but both felt canadian . the family returned often to ski , and when the boys went on school trips from boston to montreal , they took pride in showing the other students around their “ home ” country . alex made a big fuss about his canadian background , because “ at high school you always want to go counterculture ” . tim describes their childhood as “ absolutely normal ” : the family was close and spent time together at weekends ; his parents had many friends . he has no recollection of them discussing russia or the soviet union ; they never ate russian food , and the closest tim says he came to a russian was a polite boy from kazakhstan at school . their parents did not discuss their childhood much , but this was how they had always been and the boys had little reason to question it . “ i never had anything close to a suspicion regarding my parents , ” alex says . in fact , he often felt disappointed by how boring and mundane they were : “ it seemed all my friends ’ parents led much more exciting and successful lives . ” little did he know . bezrukov and vavilova had been put under fbi surveillance soon after they moved to the us , probably because of a mole in the russian agency . excerpts from their 2010 indictment suggest the couple lived with a level of intrigue most people would assume exists only within the pages of a spy novel . one paragraph recounts an intercepted communication from moscow centre ( svr headquarters ) , explaining how vavilova should plan for a trip back to her motherland . she was to fly to paris and take the train to vienna , where she would pick up a fake british passport . “ very important : 1 . sign your passport on page 32 . train yourself to be able to reproduce your signature when necessary… in the passport you ’ ll get a memo with recommendation . pls , destroy the memo after reading . be well . ” their father , meanwhile , was using his work as a consultant to penetrate us political and business circles . it is not clear whether he managed to access classified material , but fbi intercepts reported a number of contacts with former and current american officials . in the few public remarks bezrukov has made about his job , he makes it sound more like that of a thinktank analyst than a super - spy . “ intelligence work is not about risky escapades , ” he told expert magazine in 2012 . “ if you behave like bond , you ’ ll last half a day , maybe a day . even if there was an imaginary safe where all the secrets are kept , by tomorrow half of them will be outdated and useless . the best kind of intelligence is to understand what your opponent will think tomorrow , not find out what he thought yesterday . ” bezrukov and vavilova communicated with the svr using digital steganography : they would post images online that contained messages hidden in the pixels , encoded using an algorithm written for them by the svr . a message the fbi believes was sent in 2007 to bezrukov by svr headquarters was decoded as follows : “ got your note and signal . no info in our files about e . f . , bt , dk , rr . agree with your proposal to use ‘farmer ’ to start building network of students in dc . your relationship with ‘parrot ’ looks very promising as a valid source of info from us power circles . to start working on him professionally we need all available details on his background , current position , habits , contacts , opportunities , etc . ” way back in 2001 , nearly a decade before her arrest , the fbi had searched a safe - deposit box belonging to tracey foley . there they found photographs of her in her 20s , one of which bore the cyrillic imprint of the soviet company that had printed it . the family home had been bugged , possibly for many years . the fbi knew the couple ’ s real identities , even if their own children did not , but the americans preferred to keep an eye on the russian spy ring , rather than make a move . why the fbi finally acted is unclear . one suggestion is that alexander poteyev , the svr officer believed to have betrayed the group , felt his cover was blown . he reportedly fled russia in the days before the arrests ; in 2011 , a russian court sentenced him to 25 years in prison for treason in absentia . another possibility is that one of the group was getting close to sensitive information . whatever the reason , in june 2010 the fbi decided to wrap up operation ghost stories and bust the russian spy ring . i speak to tim and alex many times , in person , over skype and email . they are not uncomfortable talking about their experiences , but neither do they enjoy it much . initially , they want to speak only about their court case in canada ; but gradually they open up , answering all my questions about their extraordinary family life . i have to admit there are some details that bother me . did they really never suspect a thing ? in 2012 , the wall street journal reported that unnamed us officials claimed an fbi bug placed at the family ’ s boston home had picked up the parents revealing their true identities to tim long before the arrest . furthermore , the officials said , his parents had told tim they wanted to groom him as a russian spy . a second - generation spy would be a much more impressive asset than first - generation illegals , who had built up personas that were solid but not impregnable to background checks . tim , according to the unnamed officials , agreed he would travel to moscow for svr training and even “ saluted mother russia ” . tim strenuously denies the story , insisting it was a total fabrication . “ why would a kid who grew up his whole life believing himself to be canadian , decide to risk life in prison for a country he had never been to nor had any ties to ? furthermore , why would my parents take a similar risk in telling their teenage son their identities ? ” the claim that he saluted mother russia is “ just as ridiculous as it sounds ” , tim says . he would be happy to answer the allegations in court , but it is impossible to argue with anonymous sources . when contacted by the guardian , the fbi declined to comment on the wall street journal article . there was another thing that bothered me : was it really just coincidence that the family had planned to travel to russia that summer , and that the brothers therefore had russian visas ? yes , alex says . “ it was very much my idea to go to russia . we had this world map at home and when you looked at the pins on it , you could see we ’ d been almost everywhere but russia , so i was very curious and i was pushing for it . it was just going to be one part of our summer trip . ” in hindsight , surely , that summer trip to paris , turkey and moscow must have looked rather different . when the family were reunited in moscow in july 2010 , did the boys ask their parents what the plan had been ? had they intended to reveal everything ? or were they really going to spend a week in moscow pretending not to understand a word spoken around them ? “ i actually think that was the plan , ” alex says . “ that we would travel to russia , and maybe they might go and meet people without us . but i don ’ t think there was a plan to tell us anything . ” tim agrees . if their parents had revealed the truth , it would have made tim and alex a huge liability ; “ as professionals ” , he says , it ’ s unlikely they would have taken the risk . they doubt their parents ever planned to tell them about their real identities . “ honestly , ” tim says , “ i really don ’ t think so . it sounds strange , but yeah . ” both brothers tell me they remember , as young children , seeing their grandparents . where ? on vacation , alex says , “ somewhere in europe ” ; he can ’ t remember where , exactly . asked if he was sure the people he met were his real grandparents , he says , “ i think so . ” were they speaking russian ? “ i was really young , i have no idea , ” he says firmly . i raise the question with tim , who would have been older . he remembers seeing his grandparents every few years until he was around 11 , when they disappeared from his life . “ obviously , now when i think back on it , i kind of understand how it worked . if i had seen them when i was older , i would have realised that they don ’ t speak english – they don ’ t seem very canadian . ” at christmas , the boys would receive gifts marked “ from grandparents ” . their parents told them they lived in alberta , far from toronto , which was why they never saw them . occasionally , new photographs would arrive of the grandparents against a snowy backdrop ; it helped that the climates of alberta and siberia are not so different . if tim and alex ’ s story sounds eerily familiar to fans of the americans , the television drama about a kgb couple living in the us with their two children , that ’ s because it ’ s partly based on them . the show is set in the 1980s , providing a cold war backdrop , but the 2010 spy round - up served as an inspiration . the show ’ s creator , joe weisberg , trained to be a cia case officer in the early 1990s and , when i speak to him on the phone , tells me he always wanted to put family at the heart of the plot . “ one of the interesting things i saw when i worked at the cia was people lying to their children . if you have young children , you can ’ t tell them you work for the cia . and then , at some point , you have to pick an age and a time , and they find out that they ’ ve been lied to for most of their lives . it ’ s a difficult moment . ” when i meet alex in moscow , he has just finished watching the first season . ( he had started on previous occasions , but found it too difficult ; he and tim joked that they should sue the creators . ) his parents like the show , he tells me . “ obviously it ’ s glamorised , all this killing people and action everywhere . but it reminded them of when they were young agents , and how they felt about being in a strange new place . ” watching it , alex says , has made him more curious : what set his parents off on this path , and why ? * * * in 2010 , the spies were welcomed back to russia as heroes . after a debriefing at svr headquarters , bezrukov , vavilova and the other deportees met with then - president dmitry medvedev to receive medals for their service . later , they met with putin , and the group reportedly sang the patriotic soviet song from where the motherland begins . the authorities put on a tour : the agents and their families travelled to st petersburg , lake baikal in siberia and sochi on the black sea . the idea was to show off modern russia , and to provide them with an opportunity to bond . do they still meet up , i ask alex . “ from time to time , ” he says . he and tim were the only adolescents ; of the four couples arrested , two had younger children , while another had adult sons . even so , the other families were probably the only people in the world who could even begin to understand their surreal situation . bezrukov and vavilova found themselves back in a very different russia from the one they had left . the oldest of the agents had been retired from active espionage work for a decade , alex says , and barely remembered how to speak russian . the group were told they would no longer work for the svr , but jobs were found for them in state banks and oil companies . anna chapman was given a television series and now has her own fashion line . bezrukov was given a job at mgimo , a prestigious moscow university , and has written a book on the geopolitical challenges facing russia . tim and alex were given russian passports at the end of december 2010 ; suddenly , they became timofei and alexander vavilov . the names were “ completely new , foreign and unpronounceable for us ” , tim says . “ a real identity crisis , ” he adds with a hint of bitterness . unable to return to university for his final year , he managed to transfer to a russian university and complete his degree there , before doing an mba in london . alex was less lucky . he finished high school at the british international school in moscow , but did not want to stay in russia . he applied to university in canada , but was told he would first have to apply for a new birth certificate , and then a citizenship certificate ; only then could he renew his canadian passport . in 2012 he was admitted to the university of toronto , and applied for a four - year student visa on his russian passport . the visa was issued and he planned to depart for canada on 2 september . but four days before he was due to leave , as he was packing his bags and exchanging emails with his future roommate , he received a phone call from the canadian embassy in moscow demanding he come for an urgent interview . the meeting was hostile ; there were a lot of questions about his life and his parents . the visa was annulled before his eyes , and he lost his university place . alex has since been rejected for french and british visas . twice , he has been accepted to study at the london school of economics , but both times did not get a visa . eventually , he was able to get a visa to study elsewhere in europe ; tim travels mainly in asia , where many countries can be visited visa - free on a russian passport . if tim and alex ’ s story sounds eerily familiar to fans of the americans , the television drama about a kgb couple living in the us with their two children , that ’ s because it ’ s partly based on them . the show is set in the 1980s , providing a cold war backdrop , but the 2010 spy round - up served as an inspiration . the show ’ s creator , joe weisberg , trained to be a cia case officer in the early 1990s and , when i speak to him on the phone , tells me he always wanted to put family at the heart of the plot . “ one of the interesting things i saw when i worked at the cia was people lying to their children . if you have young children , you can ’ t tell them you work for the cia . and then , at some point , you have to pick an age and a time , and they find out that they ’ ve been lied to for most of their lives . it ’ s a difficult moment . ” when i meet alex in moscow , he has just finished watching the first season .

* * * in 2010 , the spies were welcomed back to russia as heroes . after a debriefing at svr headquarters , bezrukov , vavilova and the other deportees met with then - president dmitry medvedev to receive medals for their service . later , they met with putin , and the group reportedly sang the patriotic soviet song from where the motherland begins . the authorities put on a tour : the agents and their families travelled to st petersburg , lake baikal in siberia and sochi on the black sea . the idea was to show off modern russia , and to provide them with an opportunity to bond . do they still meet up , i ask alex . “ from time to time , ” he says . he and tim were the only adolescents ; of the four couples arrested , two had younger children , while another had adult sons . even so , the other families were probably the only people in the world who could even begin to understand their surreal situation . bezrukov and vavilova found themselves back in a very different russia from the one they had left . the oldest of the agents had been retired from active espionage work for a decade , alex says , and barely remembered how to speak russian . the group were told they would no longer work for the svr , but jobs were found for them in state banks and oil companies . anna chapman was given a television series and now has her own fashion line . bezrukov was given a job at mgimo , a prestigious moscow university , and has written a book on the geopolitical challenges facing russia . tim and alex were given russian passports at the end of december 2010 ; suddenly , they became timofei and alexander vavilov . the names were “ completely new , foreign and unpronounceable for us ” , tim says . “ a real identity crisis , ” he adds with a hint of bitterness . unable to return to university for his final year , he managed to transfer to a russian university and complete his degree there , before doing an mba in london . alex was less lucky . he finished high school at the british international school in moscow , but did not want to stay in russia . he applied to university in canada , but was told he would first have to apply for a new birth certificate , and then a citizenship certificate ; only then could he renew his canadian passport . in 2012 he was admitted to the university of toronto , and applied for a four - year student visa on his russian passport . the visa was issued and he planned to depart for canada on 2 september . but four days before he was due to leave , as he was packing his bags and exchanging emails with his future roommate , he received a phone call from the canadian embassy in moscow demanding he come for an urgent interview . the meeting was hostile ; there were a lot of questions about his life and his parents . the visa was annulled before his eyes , and he lost his university place . alex has since been rejected for french and british visas . twice , he has been accepted to study at the london school of economics , but both times did not get a visa . eventually , he was able to get a visa to study elsewhere in europe ; tim travels mainly in asia , where many countries can be visited visa - free on a russian passport . the brothers ’ battle to regain canadian citizenship is not just about logistics . moscow is not a city that embraces newcomers , and neither of them feels particularly russian . “ i feel like i have been stripped of my own identity for something i had nothing to do with , ” alex tells me . both are keen to work in asia for the time being , but want to move to canada when they feel ready to start families . more than anything , their canadian identity is the last straw they have left to grasp on to , after so much of the rest of their previous reality fell away . “ i lived for 20 years believing that i was canadian and i still believe i am canadian , nothing can change that , ” tim wrote in his affidavit to the toronto court . “ i do not have any attachment to russia , i do not speak the language , i do not know many friends there , i have not lived there for any extended periods of time and i do not want to live there . ” everyone who is born in canada is eligible for canadian citizenship , with one exception : those who are born to employees of foreign governments . but the brothers ’ toronto - based lawyer , hadayt nazami , argues that it is ridiculous to apply the provision to their case ; the whole point of the law , he says , is to prevent those who don ’ t have the responsibilities of citizenship from enjoying its privileges . ultimately , the court seems to be operating as much on emotional as on legal grounds , possibly with the wall street journal story about tim ’ s apparent recruitment at the back of its mind . but even if the brothers knew about their parents ’ activities ( and there is no hard evidence of this ) , i wondered what the court expected of them . what is a 16 - year - old who finds out he is the child of russian spies supposed to do ? call the fbi ? tim and alex have been through many months of questioning themselves and their identities , and of wondering whether they should be angry with their parents . they don ’ t want their childhood to define them as they grow older . many of their close friends know , but most of their casual acquaintances don ’ t . when asked where they are from , the default response for both is “ canada ” . they remain friends with many people from their previous life in boston , though tim says some broke off contact , mainly those whose parents were friends with his parents and felt betrayed . while they have no wish to live in russia , both brothers visit moscow every few months to see their parents . i ask them how hard it has been to keep that relationship going . was there a confrontation ? tim and alex choose their words carefully ; they want to appear rational and pragmatic , rather than emotional , it seems . “ of course , there were some very difficult times , ” tim says . “ but if i get angry with them , it ’ s not going to lead to any beneficial outcomes . ” he admits it is sad that , even though he can now spend time with his grandparents , the language barrier means he will never know them properly . “ in terms of family and keeping this whole thing together , it really doesn ’ t work out well when you choose this kind of path , ” he says , his voice trailing off wistfully . alex tells me that he sometimes wonders why his parents decided to have children at all . “ they live their lives like everyone else , making choices along the way . i am glad they had a cause they believed in so strongly , but their choices mean i feel no connection to the country they risked their lives for . i wish the world wouldn ’ t punish me for their choices and actions . it has been deeply unjust . ” a number of times , alex tells me that it is not his place to judge his parents , but that six years ago he spent a long period wrestling with “ the big question ” of whether he hated them or felt betrayed . in the end , he came to one conclusion : that they were the same people who had raised him lovingly , whatever secrets they hid . 
__label__no_relevant jets snapshots : maurice can relate to the painful experience of nhl coaches getting fired another week , another big - name nhl coach gets fired . this time it was a shocker as the vegas golden knights brought down the axe on gerard gallant , who led them to the stanley cup final in 2018 as an expansion team . with the knights on the bubble to make the playoffs this season , gallant was shown the door and was replaced by former sharks coach pete deboer , who was fired by san jose in mid - december . among the other head coaches who have been fired this year are peter laviolette ( nashville ) and mike babcock ( toronto ) , who have both taken teams to the stanley cup final . in total , six nhl coaches have been fired this season — including jim montgomery in dallas and john hynes in new jersey —and another , bill peters in calgary , resigned . winnipeg jets head coach paul maurice has been fired a few times during his 25 - year nhl career , and he ’ s sure a lot of his colleagues have been going through painful times . “ it ’ s a very painful experience , ” maurice said . “ it ’ s a very personal , yet very public , experience . “ i think this is the best analogy : you ’ re in a marriage , you love the woman but it ’ s getting a little bit rocky . then you come home one day and she says ‘paul , we ’ re going in a different direction and there ’ s gonna be a press conference in three hours and we ’ re gonna talk about how great the new husband ’ s gonna be . ’ “ so , it ’ s tough . you put your heart and soul into it and then you ’ re out . ” maurice and jon cooper of the tampa bay lightning , who will play in winnipeg on friday night , are the two longest tenured coaches in the nhl . maurice is in his fifth season , cooper his eighth . “ stay low , ” maurice joked , when asked how they manage it . “ it ’ s a lonely experience and it ’ s not easy getting fired . you ’ re passionately committed to your team and this is not a part - time job and it ’ s not casual . you lose , you think about that right until the puck drops the next game . you ’ re all in it , completely committed to it and it goes from 100 miles an hour down to zero , like that . “ what makes it easier is , if you ’ ve got some experience and you ’ ve done some quality work , you ’ re probably gonna get another chance . ” to that end , deboer , who is one of maurice ’ s best friends , was out of work for less than a month , “ when pete got fired i wasn ’ t sad for him because i knew he was gonna be back , ” maurice said . “ i didn ’ t know it was gonna be 30 days . i thought he might get to enjoy the entire month of january . “ but he ’ s gonna be ok . he has coached a long time in the nhl . ” entering play thursday , the jets were tied with the golden knights for the final western conference wild - card playoff spot with 54 points , but had two games in hand . no goal for bitettothe last time anthony bitetto scored an nhl goal was nov . 18 , 2017 , so you can imagine how excited he was when he saw his shot go in on tuesday against the vancouver canucks . “ i feel like most people , when they score a goal in the nhl , they ’ re gonna be happy , ” bitetto said . “ it ’ s not like i score many of them , so when it goes in , obviously i ’ m gonna be happy . ” unfortunately , the canucks challenged for offside and the goal was overturned , taking away bitetto ’ s first of the season . the same thing happened to defenceman carl dahlstrom earlier this season . “ it ’ s unfortunate but it was offside and they made the right call , ” bitetto said . “ you ’ ve just got to live with it and i don ’ t think there ’ s any more to it . it ’ s a bummer , but we had a lot of time left in that game and we had to re -

line , the jets enter friday ’ s game sitting 13th in the nhl in goals against per game . a great deal of that is owed to the play of goaltender connor hellebuyck , but the patchwork defence is doing a better job than most people would have expected it could . off - season departures , dustin byfuglien ’ s suspension , and injuries have forced the jets to use nine different defencemen this season , with the pairings changing on a regular basis . for friday ’ s game , dmitry kulikov will return from the flu and play with josh morrissey , while neal pionk will play alongside sami niku and bitetto will play with luca sbisa . dahlstrom has been diagnosed with a broken bone in his hand and will be out six weeks . “ the biggest thing is we all practice together and we rotate , especially when there ’ s seven of us out there , ” bitetto said . “ we all play with each other at different times . “ the biggest thing is try to find something that guy does and stick with it , so we keep it simple . i ’ ve played with ( sbisa ) before and it doesn ’ t matter who you are playing with , just play hard . ” while many people point to the jets defence group as the reason the team has given up the most shots in the league , maurice is continually impressed with their work . “ it ’ s kind of their ability to get off the mat and compete every game , ” maurice said . “ we have a really unique group back there right now and every one of them has found a way to do what they do really well as their no . 1 thing . ” nathan beaulieu and tucker poolman , who have been regulars this season , are both currently injured , so guys such as niku , sbisa and bitetto are getting regular turns . poolman has been placed on injured reserve , so it ’ s likely the jets will recall a defenceman from the manitoba moose of the ahl before they embark on a three - game road trip to chicago , carolina and columbus this weekend . “ there ’ s been some difficulties , just with changeover of partners and handedness , perhaps , but all in all i think we ’ ve handled it pretty well , ” morrissey said after practice at bell mts place on thursday . “ we have a great group of guys , we all get along and we all want to help each other . “ there are some difficulties to it for sure but we ’ ve really had the mentality that no matter who ’ s out there or who you are with , the other team doesn ’ t care . at the end of the day , you ’ ve got to make plays , make defensive plays and get the job done . “ that ’ s been our m . o . this year . you can listen to the white noise or the critics or whatever you want but at the end of the day , when you ’ re out there , there ’ s nothing you can do but make the play and play as hard as you can . i think we ’ ve been doing a pretty good job of it . ” twyman@postmedia . comtwitter . com / ted_wyman

" it ' s been a trying time , " said bridgewater mayor david mitchell , on the arrest of tobias charles doucette , who evaded capture by police for nearly a week . " last week was a roller - coaster . . . it ' s a big sense of relief in the community . " the 31 - year - old suspect was officially charged monday during a brief court hearing in bridgewater , n . s . , about 100 kilometres west of halifax . he is charged with attempted murder , assault , aggravated assault , assault with a weapon , mischief , theft of a motor vehicle , two counts of possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose , and wounding a law enforcement animal . doucette was arrested saturday night after police responded to a call about an attempted vehicle theft in the village of hebbville , n . s . the suspect fled after allegedly striking an officer in the neck with an edged weapon as police responded to a domestic violence call at a hotel in bridgewater on july 20 . doucette is accused of assaulting his common - law partner in the same incident . he was spotted by an rcmp dog and handler last tuesday in conquerall bank , n . s . , but police said he escaped into nearby woods after allegedly stabbing the dog with a stick . after going several days without finding any trace of doucette , police responded to two possible sightings of him in bridgewater on friday . he wasn ' t arrested , however , until the night after police received the call about the possible vehicle theft . at the time of his arrest , doucette was wearing shorts but had no shirt or shoes . police had established checkpoints at various sites around the bridgewater area in the past week , with one as far away as the canso causeway to cape breton , doucette ' s home region . danny macphee , bridgewater ' s deputy police chief , told reporters monday he thinks doucette never left the bridgewater area .

rise apartments . his final destination—his supposed gateway to paradise—was a residential market district brimming with civilians . when the bike exploded , ripping through coffee shops and clothing racks , a second suicide bomber unleashed an encore . even before islamic state claimed responsibility , the motive was obvious . the target—bourj el - barajneh , one of beirut ’ s congested southern suburbs—is hezbollah turf , a largely shia district in lebanon . across the border in war - torn syria , hezbollah is fighting alongside bashar al - assad ’ s forces , battling mostly sunni insurgents , isis included . the market massacre ( 47 dead ) was yet another volley . the very next night , nov . 13 , islamic state terrorists struck again—in downtown paris . if canadians had even heard about the carnage in beirut , it was quickly forgotten . three weeks later , a woman is standing in the same street market . a sunni muslim , she is wearing a checkered hijab , green and black , and holding tightly to the hand of her eight - year - old daughter . all around them , there is little evidence left of the damage . the charred debris that littered the intersection was promptly shovelled away , and a fresh coat of paint covers the cement facade that endured the brunt of the attacks . afternoon shoppers criss - cross the road as if nothing happened here , walking underneath dangling webs of wires that zigzag from balcony to balcony . “ i have not been outside since the explosion , ” the woman says , speaking arabic . “ if you didn ’ t call me to meet you , i wouldn ’ t have come outside . it is too scary . ” her name is amal alkhalaf , and although she doesn ’ t realize it yet , that name alone means so much to so many . on the other side of the world—in peterborough , ont . , a city that could not be further away from the armed checkpoints that surround bourj el - barajneh—a group of strangers has made it their mission to sponsor her family and bring them to canada , despite never seeing her face or hearing her voice . all they know is her name , and that she and her three kids , living somewhere in lebanon , are among the many millions of syrian refugees who fled for their lives . the people in peterborough have no idea that this woman and her children , two girls and a boy , escaped isis territory 14 months ago , only to have islamic state ’ s violence follow them to lebanon . they don ’ t know that the kids have not been to school in nearly two years . “ i worry about them constantly , ” says kristy hiltz , a veterinarian who spearheaded the sponsorship group . “ i really hope they know that somebody out there is already very attached to them . ” in countless ways , syria ’ s humanitarian crisis has brought out the very best in canadians , even before justin trudeau ’ s liberals swept to power on a campaign promise to welcome 25 , 000 refugees in record time . a single , sickening image—a three - year - old boy dead on a beach , when british columbia could have been home—became a nationwide rallying cry . hundreds of private sponsorship groups mobilized in a matter of days , each one determined to rescue the next alan kurdi . this is the story of one of those groups—a collection of 14 everyday canadians motivated by the same , simple goal as all the groups : to do what ’ s right . to do something . this is a story about a facebook post , and the wide cast of characters who answered the challenge . a story about teachers and scientists and a jewish dance instructor who didn ’ t hesitate to donate time and money . a story about professors . a cop . a blues musician . an engineer . a decorated soldier . a vietnamese boat person determined to pay forward the generosity that saved her own family . this is a story about a city ( population 79 , 000 ) that has a long , quiet history of welcoming refugees . a city where the newly elected mp was herself a refugee—but a city that also made global headlines after someone , post - paris , firebombed its only mosque . more than anything , though , this is a story about a woman with a name , a resilient but frightened single mother who has no idea her canadian sponsors even exist—until this december afternoon , when maclean ’ s tracks her down in beirut ’ s notorious southern suburbs . amal alkhalaf only knows that she and her children have been accepted for resettlement , nothing more . she has certainly never heard of a place called peterborough . david mcnab has a nickname for his wife of 23 years : the freight train of enthusiasm . when kristy hiltz puts her mind to something , in other words , don ’ t even think about standing in her tracks . the moniker fits dave just as well . “ we tend to look at things in terms of : ‘how can we help ? ’ ” he says . “ or at least we try to . ” their own marriage is proof of the couple ’ s devotion to seeing things through . dave met kristy during a jamaican vacation , and they embarked on a long - distance love when both returned to their homes ( kristy to peterborough ; dave to his ontario provincial police posting in haileybury , five hours north ) . although const . mcnab did secure a transfer to bancroft ( only 100 km from his fiancée ) , another 18 months would pass—including seven as husband and wife—before the couple lived under the same roof . dave has been stationed in peterborough ever since . ninety minutes northeast of toronto , peterborough is known as “ the electric city ” because it was the first in canada to use electric streetlights ( 1884 ) . the community ’ s official name dates back to peter robinson , a politician who oversaw the region ’ s first major immigration wave in 1825 : the arrival of 2 , 000 irish - catholic farmers . today , the population remains overwhelmingly white ( fewer than four per cent are visible minorities ) and increasingly elderly . add in the surrounding townships , and nearly one in five is a senior . ask the locals what they treasure most—besides the petes , the junior hockey team that has produced a long list of nhlers—and two answers top the list : the city ’ s small - town feel , and the kindness of neighbours . one recent survey asked residents to rank what they love about peterborough . “ we are a caring community ” was the no . 1 response . ‘i worry about them constantly ’ dave and kristy raised their three kids in the rural countryside of millbrook , a neighbouring township where the children displayed their own caring side in the early 2000s . members of a group called “ kids 4 turtles ” lobbied local politicians to erect traffic signs on country roads , warning drivers to watch out for the little reptiles crossing the street . mom , the freight train of enthusiasm , later helped launch the kawartha turtle trauma centre , where , to this day , injured turtles are rehabilitated and released . dave caught some grief from fellow officers ( “ f–k , dave . turtles ? ” one sergeant razzed him ) but not anymore . “ i still get texts from people saying : ‘hey , i saved a turtle , ’ ” he laughs . like so many around the world , kristy was repulsed when she first saw the photo : a lifeless little boy , face down on the shore of a turkish resort . alan kurdi resembled anyone ’ s precious toddler , dressed in blue shorts and a red t - shirt . “ it was too much , ” says the 51 - year - old . “ i don ’ t know how else to say it . ” in an instant , one photo awakened the world to a refugee crisis that had been unfolding in plain sight for four years . in canada—where the federal election campaign was in full throttle—horror turned to outrage after a report that the boy ’ s aunt , a hairdresser in port coquitlam , b . c . , had applied to sponsor the family of alan ’ s uncle , with the hope of one day sponsoring alan ’ s family , too . after ottawa rejected his brother ’ s application , alan ’ s father hatched a far more dangerous plan : piling his family into a motorboat bound for the greek island of kos . along with alan , the mediterranean sea swallowed his five - year - old brother , galib , and their mother , rehana . on sept . 4 , the friday before labour day weekend , kristy posted alan ’ s photo on her facebook feed . “ this child and his family should be alive in canada today , ” she wrote . “ canada , and the rest of the world , needs to step up to help refugees , or their blood is on our hands . ” like so many , kristy hiltz was horrified : ‘this child and his family should be alive in canada ’ if statistics told the entire story , ottawa was not exactly ignoring the plight of syrian refugees . last january , eight months before alan died , stephen harper ’ s conservatives announced a plan to resettle 10 , 000 displaced syrians over the next three years ( after already welcoming 1 , 300 under a previous promise ) . but in the eyes of many canadians , that was hardly enough . from coast to coast , frontline organizations that assist immigrants and refugees couldn ’ t answer the ringing telephones fast enough . among those flooded with voicemails was the new canadians centre ( ncc ) , a peterborough settlement agency that offers everything from language training to job counselling . “ people were asking : ‘what are you guys doing ? what can we do ? ’ ” says tamara hoogerdyk of the ncc . “ so we thought , ‘well , we have to take the lead on this . ’ ” staff scrambled to organize a sponsorship workshop on sept . 10 , one week after the image hit the internet . more than 70 people showed up , including kristy hiltz . “ i went to hear what they had to say . and i thought : ‘we can do this . we can totally do this . ’ ” a crisis negotiator , dave was deployed out of town at the time . kristy dialled his cell . “ she was very excited , ” he remembers . “ the idea , to me , seemed terrific , although intimidating . but the more i talked to kristy , the more it just made sense . ” dave himself is an immigrant , coming from scotland as a toddler . the following day , sept . 11 , kristy posted another facebook message to her 300 - plus friends . “ dave and i want to co - sponsor a refugee , individual or family , ” she wrote . “ we are looking for people who would be willing to co - sponsor with us . ” the plan was for each volunteer to donate money ( at least $500 per person , or $1 , 000 per couple ) and one year of time and energy . for a brief moment , kristy felt extremely vulnerable . what if nobody responded ? myra hirschberg was born and raised in new york city , the granddaughter of eastern european jews who immigrated to the united states in the early 20th century . from a young age , she understood— “ breathed in , ” as she puts it—the importance of helping those less fortunate . “ it is an inherent part of the jewish religion : to share what you have with others , ” she says . “ it ’ s true of every religion i ’ m familiar with , including islam . ” ‘there is actually something we can do that is going to make a difference ’ her true passion is dancing—contra - dancing , in particular . it ’ s sort of like square dancing , except it ’ s done in lines . now in her 60s , myra has travelled all over north america to teach others the steps . it ’ s how she met her canadian husband , tom calwell , an aerospace engineer . “ we were at a dance week in west virginia , ” she recalls . the couple retired to peterborough , where kristy hiltz is their veterinarian . “ the plight of refugees was all over the news , and i had been spending days feeling completely helpless to do anything concrete , ” myra says . “ when kristy posted that message it was like : ‘there is actually something we can do that is going to make a difference in somebody ’ s life . ’ ” her husband was immediately on board . “ i was feeling as a country we were getting a really bad rep , ” tom says , “ and i wanted to do anything positive . ” ‘their names and ages—that ’ s all we know ’ lise fines didn ’ t hesitate , either . a grade 7 teacher at st . paul ’ s elementary school , she and her husband , rick , first met kristy more than a decade ago , when she performed two surgeries , free of charge , on their ailing dog . “ we always think : ‘who do we want our three - year - old daughter to become , and how is she going to learn that ? ’ ” says lise , 46 . “ i wanted her to see that this is what we can do if someone needs our help . ” she and rick , a blues and folk musician , sat down to hammer out a payment plan . “ i imagine myself there and how hopeless it would feel , ” says rick , 53 . two days later , lise was chopping away in her kitchen beside a close friend , stephanie melles , an ecology professor at ryerson university . melles ’ s research specialty is ecoinformatics ( an emerging field that integrates stats and engineering into the study of ecosystems ) , but on that sunday afternoon , the task at hand was a bit less complicated : prepping slow - cooker meals for the freezer , from mongolian beef to green chili pork . as lise and stephanie sliced and measured , the conversation turned to syrian refugees . like lise , stephanie has a three - year - old , and the photo of alan hit close to home . “ it almost looked like he was sleeping , ” she says . some of her ryerson colleagues were already working to sponsor syrians , but because stephanie commutes to toronto , she wouldn ’ t have been much help to a family resettling near campus . lise had a better idea : she put her in touch with kristy . “ steph jumped on it right away , ” says her husband , trevor middel , a fisheries biologist . the group takes shapetop row : dance teacher myra hirschberg , french teacher paulette quinn , and nurse practitioner and retired canadian forces major lee - anne quinn . middle row : retired engineer tom calwell , grade 7 teacher carla gorman , and fisheries biologist trevor middel . bottom row : grade 7 teacher lise fines , musician rick fines , and ecology professor stephanie melles . the group was quickly taking shape : kristy and dave ( the vet and the cop ) . myra and tom ( the dancer and the engineer ) . rick and lise ( the musician and the teacher ) . trevor and stephanie ( the biologist and the prof ) . lise—herself a freight train of enthusiasm—recruited another co - sponsor with no previous connection to kristy or dave : paulette quinn , the french teacher at st . paul ’ s . one of eight brothers and sisters , the 59 - year - old is always fundraising for one school cause or another . “ sometimes all you can do is send some money somewhere , ” she says . “ but this was really getting involved in bringing a family over and looking after that family . ” one of paulette ’ s younger sisters , lee - anne quinn , lives right across the street , and every night after supper they head out for a walk . during one september stroll , she told lee - anne about the group , knowing full well her sibling would jump to join . “ that ’ s just the kind of person lee - anne is , ” paulette says . not that lee - anne would ever say so . “ she ’ s very discrete , ” paulette says , putting it mildly . when asked about herself , lee - anne is accurate but brief . a nurse practitioner , she served 23 years in the canadian forces , including four tours ( in the former yugoslavia , somalia , rwanda and afghanistan ) . maj . quinn ’ s family had no doubt she would join the military ; even as a young girl , she was ultra - organized , ensuring the others folded their clothes and made their beds . her kandahar deployment ( 2007 - 08 ) was an eight - month whirlwind at the multinational hospital , where she helped treat a constant influx of battlefield casualties . more than once , she held the hand of a canadian soldier as he took his final breaths . “ it ’ s actually a privilege to be in that position , ” she says . some days , lee - anne would set up a clinic in a desolate patch of the country , where local women and children had never seen a medical professional before . “ i don ’ t live in ignorance , ” she says . “ i know there are some desperate corners of our world out there , and when you see it , you really get a sense of appreciation for what canada has to offer . ” maj . quinn retired in 2008 , never thinking twice about where her next posting would be : back home . “ when the sponsorship project was presented to me i thought : ‘wow , being retired military , i can still make a difference for people who live so far away , ’ ” she says . “ it ’ s quite humbling , actually . ” lee - anne neglects to mention how she volunteered to serve three stints as the only health - care provider in a remote first nations community , where her work with children—including building an outdoor rink , and convincing the nhl players association to fly in sticks , pucks and skates—earned her the nightingale award as ontario ’ s top nurse . her order of military merit , the canadian forces ’ equivalent to the order of canada ? she doesn ’ t bring that up , either . paulette does . “ that is not important today , ” lee - anne says . “ what ’ s important today is getting a family to safety . ” from the outside , there is nothing unique about the brick house with the arched front door . it blends right in with all the other homes on this residential road near downtown peterborough . a nun answers the doorbell , wearing black pants and a violet sweater . “ welcome , ” she says . it is not the first time—nor the last—sister ruth hennessey has uttered that reassuring word to someone standing on her front porch . all these years later , sister ruth still marvels at how she ended up here , living in a bedroom upstairs while so many refugees come and go on the two floors below . a teacher for nearly four decades , she is part of the local sisters of st . joseph , a congregation that started opening its motherhouse to refugees in the 1990s . demand soon trumped capacity . “ one summer i was asked to find a house , ” she says . “ this one was in a good neighbourhood and it had a basement apartment . ” they called the property casa maria . the nuns went on to buy two other homes , providing temporary accommodation to more than 150 refugee families since 1994 . “ i have such faith in these people that come to us , ” says sister ruth , now in her late 70s . “ they are good people—wonderful people . ” she has chronicled each one , their photos filling numerous albums spread out on the dining room table . among the smiling faces is a 12 - year - old girl from afghanistan—maryam monsef—who came to casa maria , with her mother and two sisters , in the spring of 1996 . they lived in the basement apartment . “ she didn ’ t speak a word of english , ” sister ruth recalls , flipping through the photographs . “ they had nothing when they arrived here . ” how things would change . peterborough ’ s newly elected liberal mp , maryam monsef , arrived in canada as a refugeewhen kristy hiltz posted her facebook challenge , monsef , now 30 , was running as the local liberal candidate in the federal election . her eventual victory made her the first afghan - born mp , and her cabinet post ( minister of democratic institutions ) marked another historic first . “ maryam would always say : ‘i ’ m going to make you proud of me , ’ ” sister ruth recalls . “ and i would say : ‘i ’ ve always been proud of you . ’ ” most of the refugees who funnel through casa maria are not sponsored ; they manage to get to canada on their own , then file asylum claims . a few times a year , however , casa maria does apply to sponsor a specific refugee living overseas . “ the process is very , very slow , ” sister ruth says . “ but once this little boy ’ s picture was shown across the world , people came alive and wanted to do something . ” she knew exactly where to point all those motivated people : aspa bouzinelos . years from now , when peterborough has a thriving community of syrian - canadians , aspa will be a major reason why . ‘we have to be there for them , walk with them ’ a longtime member of casa maria ’ s advisory board ( and a greek immigrant who teaches english as a second language ) , aspa had just taken the reins of another volunteer position : the sponsorship agreement holder ( sah ) rep at the roman catholic diocese of peterborough . numbering nearly 100 across canada , a sah is an organization approved by ottawa as a trusted partner in refugee resettlement . ranging from the salvation army to the mennonite central committee , sahs can either sponsor refugees directly or allow groups to apply under their umbrella . simply put , it is infinitely easier for a new group to work with a sah ; processing times are much faster , and approval rates much higher . “ people started phoning and asking if they could meet , ” aspa says . the calls still haven ’ t stopped ; at last count , the diocese is working with 35 sponsorship groups in the peterborough area . “ i manage , ” aspa smiles . “ i go home at night and respond to all the emails . ” when she sat down with kristy ’ s group for the first time , on sunday , sept . 20 , it was the fourth group she ’ d met that day . ‘it just really struck a chord with me ’ they gathered in the living room at casa maria : kristy , dave , myra , tom , stephanie and lise . sister ruth poured coffee for the guests as aspa explained the basics . although most groups sponsor a friend or relative of someone already in canada , there is another stream—the “ blended visa office - referred , ” or bvor—in which ottawa matches groups with vulnerable families recommended for resettlement by the united nations refugee agency . under that program , ottawa covers six months of income support ( up to $13 , 500 ) while the group pays the other six months ( hence the term “ blended ” ) . but there is one major downside to the program : cases are extremely rare . by the time kristy ’ s group convened at casa maria , only 29 syrian refugees had arrived under the bvor stream since the beginning of 2014 . nevertheless , everyone at the meeting was optimistic that somehow , some way , they ’ d be matched with a family who needed their help . it happened before , after all . one of the group ’ s own members—phung tran , sitting with the others that sunday—was living proof . there was no internet back then . no twitter . no medium for a single photo to spread across the globe in a matter of minutes . but when those black - and - white images hit front pages in 1979—tens of thousands of indochinese refugees , fleeing communism on flimsy , overcrowded boats—the reaction was equally visceral : canadians needed to help . prime minister joe clark responded with a now - historic pledge , vowing to open canada ’ s doors to 50 , 000 boat people over the next 18 months ( a target later boosted to 60 , 000 ) . more than half would end up being privately sponsored—including 11 who landed in the small town of sussex , n . b . , their resettlement paid for by the parishioners of st . paul ’ s united church . “ we had to raise $12 , 000 , ” recalls daniel keith , the church ’ s clerk of the session at the time . “ amongst the congregation , everyone just ponied up . ” the newcomers included a young family airlifted out of a malaysian refugee camp : loc and chu tran , and their 18 - month - old daughter , phung . daniel ’ s daughter , mary , first met the trans in the church nursery . mary was pregnant with her second daughter , as was chu . “ chu looked across the room at me and i saw her hand slide down her stomach , ” says mary , now 65 . “ i thought to myself : ‘she is pregnant . ’ i can still remember that moment , and i often think about how that gesture bridged the whole cultural divide . ” it also marked the beginning of a lifelong bond between the trans and the keiths . they are family now , not friends . a teacher back in south vietnam , phung ’ s father quickly found work at a refrigeration company , then at a poultry plant . in between shifts , he took english classes—in saint john , 70 km away . ( parishioners volunteered to drive him back and forth . ) when he and chu were busy at work , loc would often ask if daniel and his wife , ann , could babysit . they never refused . “ my mother was a very kind person , but she didn ’ t let people into her life easily , ” mary says . “ she did completely in this case . she just loved those children dearly . ” phung and her baby sister , lea , spent so much time at the keith home that they came to consider ann and daniel their “ canadian grandparents . ” mary still has photos of the tran girls playing with her daughters , frances and eliza . “ they enriched our lives so much , ” she says , her voice cracking . “ helping this family was probably the most gratifying thing i ’ ve ever done in my life . ” after nearly four years in new brunswick , loc and chu made the difficult decision to move their family to toronto , 1 , 500 km away . though grateful to everyone at st . paul ’ s , especially the keiths , they felt ontario offered the best future . “ it was sad for us , ” says daniel , now 94 . “ loc was just like a brother to me . ” despite the distance , the families never lost touch . the keiths followed from afar as loc and chu , both employed at a duck farm , reaped the benefits of their hard work . they bought a home in suburban newmarket , put their kids through post - secondary school , and saved enough for a comfortable retirement . “ in some ways , i think they ’ re still in shock , ” phung , now 38 , says of her parents . “ they have a little house here on pigeon lake , just outside of peterborough . and their kids have houses now . ” a graduate of trent university , phung is a biologist with the ontario ministry of natural resources , where she works on species - at - risk legislation . she met her husband , fellow biologist brad steinberg , while conducting field research at algonquin park . they have a son , jack . when their daughter was born two years ago , they named her annie—in honour of phung ’ s “ canadian grandmother . ” sadly , ann was in a nursing home by then , suffering from late - stage alzheimer ’ s disease . “ it brought tears to my eyes , ” daniel says , remembering the first time he heard the baby ’ s name . “ i tried to tell my wife , but i don ’ t know if she could take it in . ” ann keith died on dec . 2 , 2014 , shortly after her 66th wedding anniversary . a few months later , phung received a letter in the mail—with a cheque from ann ’ s estate . ann had inherited some money late in life , and before alzheimer ’ s clouded her mind , she crafted a will that ensured all her loved ones , the trans included , received a share . phung was so surprised that she phoned mary in new brunswick to make sure it wasn ’ t a mistake . “ i didn ’ t know if i deserved it , ” she says . “ i was stunned . ” it ’ s what mom wanted , mary assured her . “ it confirmed that she felt we were her grandkids , too , ” phung says . ‘it ’ s part of my life . it ’ s part of my story . ’ she and brad invested some of ann ’ s money in the kids ’ resps , but weren ’ t quite sure what to do with the rest . then phung read kristy ’ s facebook post . “ when the photo of alan kurdi was all over the place , it was pretty tough for me , ” she says . “ there is always that sense of guilt : ‘why did i make it when so many others didn ’ t ? ’ ” phung and brad knew exactly what to do , pledging $1 , 000—and their time and energy—toward kristy ’ s group . “ this was a way for phung to sort of pay it forward , ” brad says . “ someone 35 years ago—strangers—brought her family over , and for us to be able to do the same thing was pretty important . ” a perfect tribute to ann ’ s memory . for phung , joining the group also provided something else : the motivation to learn more about her own story . she was too young to remember her family ’ s harrowing boat ride to malaysia , and her parents have shared few details . “ we had to make the decisions we had to make , ” was the extent of their answer , whenever she asked . “ this whole experience has given me that push , that opportunity , to talk about these things and ask my parents questions without feeling awkward or out of place , ” she says . “ it ’ s meant so much to me . ” carla gorman has known aspa for years . sister ruth , too . teachers tend to cross paths , especially in smaller centres like peterborough . “ the picture of that little boy , it broke my heart , ” carla says . “ i was talking to aspa and i said : ‘you know what ? i really want to help somehow , i want to join a group . ’ and aspa said : ‘well , lise has one . ’ ” which was perfect for carla . lise teaches one grade 7 class at st . paul ’ s ; carla teaches the other . the group was now up to 13 . it also had a name : salaam peterborough—families helping families . sept . 25 , exactly two weeks after kristy ’ s post , was a huge day . sponsorship agreement holders were put on notice that ottawa was about to post 50 new syrian cases to the bvor stream . basic summaries of each case ( genders , ages , etc . ) would be shared , via email ; sahs could then claim a particular file , like a general manager on draft day . aspa wasn ’ t overly optimistic . syrian refugees were suddenly in high demand , and she knew each case would be scooped up . her hunch proved correct ; only 15 files were posted that friday , and none went to her diocese . the following monday , sept . 28 , another email arrived in her inbox . “ dear sponsors , ” it read . “ please find information on 10 more syrian bvor cases . ” the attached list included : bvor 417 : a mother and three children , ages 12 , 10 and 8 . bvor 418 : a husband , wife and three children , ages 7 , 6 and 3 . bvor 420 : another husband , wife and three children , ages 19 , 16 and 14 . aspa replied right away , saying she had a group willing to accept any of those three . she typed so frantically she misspelled her name at the end of the email ( asoa ) . “ i responded in 4 minutes ! ” she wrote lise at 12 : 16 p . m . “ let ’ s see what happens . ” another four minutes after that , aspa received the reply that eluded her on friday . “ hi aspa . bvor 417 is on hold for your sah . ” just 17 days after kristy turned to facebook in search of fellow sponsors , the group she created had been matched with its family : a single mom and three kids living in lebanon . while serving in afghanistan , lee - anne quinn treated children in remote villagesit was lunch hour at school when lise , sitting at her desk , received the confirmation email . she pumped her fist in the air— “ yes ! ” —and sprinted out of the classroom , her grade 7s trailing behind . “ i scooted as fast as i could to find carla and tell her the news , ” lise says . “ we hugged and jumped for joy , and then we went down the hall to find paulette . it was just a really exciting moment for us . ” one student asked if they ’ d won the lottery . “ something like that , ” mrs . fines replied . the confirmation email did not include the names ( or faith ) of the four family members , but it did provide some additional details about bvor 417 . the mother , a syrian , was described as a 41 - year - old homemaker with no education . her husband—wherever he was , dead or alive—appeared to be iraqi because all three kids were listed as iraqi citizens ( although the youngest daughter was born in syria , suggesting the family had moved back to the mother ’ s home country after living in iraq . ) under the category “ urgency ” was one word , in capital letters : high . when myra hirschberg read those details , she had two immediate thoughts . “ one was : ‘this woman doesn ’ t speak english , she has three kids , she is a single parent , and it ’ s going to be a major job for her to get on her feet when she gets here , ’ ” she says . “ thought two was : ‘she must be an amazingly strong person to have managed on her own to survive what she survived with three kids . ’ i don ’ t think i could have made it as far . ” ‘i think she ’ s pretty brave ’ by this point , the nation was immersed in two diversions : the tail end of the election campaign , and toronto blue jays playoff baseball . but with a family now secured , the group focused on its fundraising efforts . they needed $13 , 500 to match ottawa ’ s contribution , and the members ’ personal pledges put them about halfway there . a mix of social media and word - of - mouth would raise the rest—and then some . “ generosity begets generosity , ” says trevor , stephanie ’ s husband . “ it helps when people see we are just everyday canadians reaching out to help this family . ” friends and relatives handed over cash . a yoga instructor organized special classes , donating 100 per cent of the proceeds . a local painter auctioned off three pieces of art . kristy ’ s vet clinic set up $10 nail trims , with every penny going toward salaam peterborough ( the very first customer gave $100 instead ) . dentists offered their services free of charge . doctors , too . carla organized an auction at her house , where st . paul ’ s staff bid on each other ’ s services ( yard duty , for instance ) . she raised $1 , 400 . “ this has kind of renewed my faith in humanity , ” she says . “ people desperately , desperately want to help ; they just need the right outlet to contribute , ” says brad , phung ’ s husband . “ it ’ s been heartwarming to see the community rally behind us . ” and not only behind them . in addition to the 35 groups working with aspa , two dozen others are in the process of bringing syrian refugees to the peterborough region . by the end of 2016 , the city expects to be home to 350 , maybe more . “ i am not surprised at all , ” says serout omar , who owns a pizza parlour in town . “ peterborough is full of great people , i ’ m telling you . ” he would know . twenty years ago , a church group sponsored his family of iraqi kurds , who lived 10 years in a syrian refugee camp after fleeing saddam hussein ’ s chemical weapons . “ this is my home , ” says serout , 36 . “ i would never move . ” when he read about kristy ’ s group in a local newspaper , serout immediately reached out on facebook to offer help , including translating for the family once they arrive . his generosity allowed the members to check one more box on their very large to - do list . every sponsorship group must create a detailed settlement plan that meets the approval of their sah . where will the family live ? who will pick them up at the airport ? landline or cellphone ? salaam peterborough crafted an excel spreadsheet , with each line listing a different duty . apartment rental . school enrolment . social insurance numbers . neighbourhood tour . they were ready , or at least as ready as they could be . on nov . 12 , aspa received another update in her inbox : the woman and her kids had been interviewed by visa officers in beirut , and all ottawa needed was final confirmation that kristy ’ s group would be the sponsor . “ please go ahead and confirm , ” lise wrote back to aspa . “ yay ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i am so excited ! ” the group still didn ’ t know any names . they also had no idea that the anonymous family was huddled inside their beirut apartment at that very moment , steps from a busy market where two isis bombers went to die . ‘i ’ ve seen firsthand the desperation that these people live in ’ when shazim khan first noticed the sirens blinking in the distance , he assumed it was a car crash . as he steered closer , he saw the fire hoses pointed at his peterborough mosque . “ it was devastating , ” he recalls . “ someone threw some kind of accelerant through the window , but we don ’ t know who it was . ” the nov . 14 arson made international headlines : a canadian mosque—masjid al - salaam , literally the “ peace mosque ” —had been firebombed , an apparent hate crime triggered by islamic state ’ s rampage in paris the night before . smoke engulfed the main floor , plastering walls with soot and ash . some of the mosque ’ s 100 worshippers had been mingling inside only an hour earlier , celebrating the birth of a baby . “ this is the only mosque in peterborough , ” says khan , originally from guyana , who has served as imam for eight years . “ we thought it would be a huge setback for the community , but it actually turned out to be the opposite . ” a local man with no link to the mosque launched an online crowd - funding campaign to cover the repair bill , and within 30 hours , donations topped $110 , 000 . among the many who rushed to give were members of salaam peterborough . “ i think the person or people who attacked the mosque unwittingly gave a huge boost to the movement to welcome syrian refugees—because so many in the community became so eager to prove that those people were not representative of us , ” says myra , the dance instructor . “ i hope they are reading this and notice that . ” imam shazim khan says sponsoring refugees is god ’ s workstill , the apparent trigger behind the mosque arson—the terrorist attacks in paris , which killed 130—raised legitimate questions about the new government ’ s refugee plan , specifically the timing . reports out of france said one of the isis attackers might have been a syrian who snuck into europe amid the flood of migrants . was canada doing enough to conduct security checks on these potential newcomers ? and why the rush ? why do all 25 , 000 need to arrive by the end of 2015 ? liberal public safety minister ralph goodale assured canadians that every last syrian would be properly screened before arriving , but prime minister justin trudeau himself would later concede that the horror in paris played a role in his decision to slow down the original pledge . ( instead of bringing in 25 , 000 refugees by the end of 2015 , the new plan is to fly them all here by the end of february . ) ‘the mosque means a lot to this community ’ a career police officer , dave mcnab is anything but naive . he has witnessed his fair share of depravity , and he admits the bloodshed in paris sparked some soul - searching . “ i don ’ t think anybody in this group isn ’ t scared about the terrorist attacks , but ultimately you have to do what is right , ” he says . “ i don ’ t think you could look at a picture of a needy child and not know what the right thing is . ” ( says trevor : “ this is a mother and three children , and i really don ’ t think they ’ re any danger to our society . ” ) dave is standing at his kitchen counter , chopping lamb for tonight ’ s kebabs . kristy is beside him , prepping a pan of baklava . it is nov . 22 , another sunday , and the rest of the group members are on their way over for a meeting / celebration . aspa is coming , too , bringing along the final bits of paperwork . once signed , the sponsorship will become official . “ we ’ re doing a middle eastern theme , ” kristy says . “ i ’ m so excited . ” the members arrive at the front door , one by one . as the living room fills and the volume grows , the scene looks like any random cocktail party . a newcomer would have no idea that some of these people didn ’ t know each other two months ago . “ it ’ s been amazing , ” phung says . “ you couldn ’ t have asked for a better of group of people . ” lise and rick arrive with some homemade hummus . “ i feel like i ’ ve been thinking about her and the kids every day since sept . 28 , ” lise says , when asked about the family . “ i wonder : ‘are they hungry ? are they cold ? are they scared ? do they know we ’ re here ? do they know that we ’ re thinking about them and that we ’ re waiting for them ? ’ ” kristy invited another special guest tonight : shazim khan . it ’ s been a week since the mosque was firebombed , and the repair work has barely begun . ( mosque officials would later announce that their insurance policy covered the reconstruction , and that every penny raised by the crowd - funding campaign was donated to local charities . ) “ we are different , ” the imam tells the group , the living room hushed . he is wearing a white islamic robe and a black skull cap . “ we have different religious beliefs , we practise differently , but i think we share a lot of common values . we all care for one another , and this is what makes us human beings . ” “ our prophet said : ‘one who helps an orphan or a widow is like a person who stands in prayer and never finishes , ’ ” khan continues . “ i want to say how grateful we are that we have people in our community who are willing to share in this very noble task . ” group members sign the final paperwork with aspa bouzinelos ( left ) and sister ruth hennessey ( right ) when the time comes to sign the papers , aspa puts the documents on the coffee table . some group members hold up their smartphones and press record . kristy and lise do the honours , scribbling their signatures on multiple pages . neither can contain her smile . among the documents—finally—is the mystery woman ’ s name : amal alkhalaf , age 41 . the eldest daughter is ansam , who had just turned 13 . ibrahim is the boy , age 10 . the youngest , eight years old , is dalya . her ninth birthday is a few weeks away . long before the world knew the name alan kurdi , scores of syrian migrants followed the same watery path from turkey to greece , gambling their very lives for asylum in europe . thousands more have set out since . ( on jan . 4 , the mediterranean claimed another 36 victims , including three children . ) yet despite the dominant images—refugees wearing life jackets , crammed into rubber boats—the vast majority of displaced syrians are not trying to reach britain or germany or sweden . they are in purgatory , spread out among syria ’ s immediate neighbours . across the southern border in jordan , the united nations refugee agency ( unhcr ) has registered close to 800 , 000 . to the north , 2 . 2 million live in turkey . and to the west , lebanon has absorbed 1 . 1 million , if not more . the crisis may be most glaring in lebanon , an already fractured state that ’ s barely twice the size of prince edward island . before the war next door , the population was about four million ; it is now above five million—all while the lebanese government continues to spiral into disarray . sectarian squabbling has left the country without a president for nearly 600 days , and basic civic services have ground to a halt . drive anywhere , and it won ’ t be long before you ’ ll see a mound of garbage bags tossed on a roadside . tragically , the same is true about syrian refugees . they are literally everywhere here : sleeping on street corners , inside overcrowded motel rooms , and underneath plastic tarps that fill hundreds of rural , ramshackle camps . but unlike jordan , for example—where one camp , zaatari , is home to nearly 80 , 000 syrian refugees—there is no such central hub in lebanon . in fact , fewer than 20 per cent of the refugees here live in a camp . maclean ’ s travelled to lebanon in the hope , however slim , of finding amal alkhalaf and her children . other than their names ( and their canadian file number : bvor 417 ) , the peterborough group had no other leads to share . no city . no phone number . not even a photograph . the whole assignment had the feel of saving private ryan . for nearly a week , nothing panned out . sources working for various aid agencies queried their databases but came up empty . one said he actually found dozens of amal alkhalafs in his system , way too many to narrow down . if nothing else , the hail mary hunt reinforced just how lucky this woman is : maclean ’ s was scouring the country for a syrian refugee already selected to come to canada , while crossing paths with thousands more who will never receive such a gift . in the end , it was michelle cameron , canada ’ s ambassador to lebanon , who pulled the right strings . maclean ’ s reached out to the embassy , explaining the basics of this article and asking whether someone could contact amal on our behalf . on dec . 2 , the answer arrived . “ we found her , ” cameron said . she had a cell number . amal was willing to meet , but physically reaching her was hardly routine . maclean ’ s needed permission from hezbollah ’ s central press office just to pass through the military checkpoints that surround bourj el - barajneh , and the magazine was specifically instructed not to film or photograph outside . only three weeks had passed since the isis suicide attacks , and residents remained leery of unfamiliar faces . ( though a largely shia municipality , bourj el - barajneh is home to some sunnis , including a growing number of syrian refugees , because rent is relatively cheap . ) as planned , amal is waiting on the corner , dalya by her side . the little girl is wearing jeans and a sweater , green and red . mother and daughter don ’ t linger long , turning down an alleyway that leads back to their latest home : a decrepit , two - room apartment . the older kids , ansam and ibrahim , are inside the first - floor unit , though not alone . one of amal ’ s sisters - in - law also lives here—with her four children . at night , all nine squish together on the living - room carpet , sleeping in a windowless space that resembles a cave . the apartment ’ s other room is a small kitchen with cracked , crumbling walls . its only saving grace is the running water . after two islamic state suicide bombers struck her beirut neighbourhood on nov . 12 , amal and the children stopped going outside “ it was so scary , ” amal says , recalling the thunder of the twin explosions . “ but thank god my children weren ’ t in the street at that time . ” she has not let them outside since . a petite woman , barely five feet tall , amal sits down on the living room floor , her back leaning against the front door . dalya is still close by . ibrahim is beside them , wearing a thin brown jacket and bare feet . ansam ’ s hijab is navy blue . though only 13 , ansam is mature beyond her years , a second mom to the other two . “ i would love to study , ” she says , holding back tears . “ my only dream is to study . ” originally from the syrian city of raqqa , amal married an iraqi , and their first two children were born in her husband ’ s home country . during the second gulf war , however , the family crossed back to syria , where dalya was born in 2006 . they eventually settled in homs—a city that would soon be under siege . north of damascus , homs endured some of the heaviest fighting in the early months of the syrian uprising , as assad ’ s forces tried , but failed , to quell anti - government protests in the city . in august 2011 , amal ’ s husband left home , supposedly in search of food . he never came back . “ i don ’ t know anything about what happened to him , ” she says . “ i don ’ t know where he is . ” after a week , amal says she had no choice but to flee , taking the kids to the eastern city of al - bukamal , where some of her relatives lived . for a while , the kids were able to attend school , including some english classes , but it wasn ’ t long before isis took control of the city . yet again , the family was pinned into a combat zone . “ i don ’ t like the kids to talk about it , ” amal says . “ i am trying to get them to forget what happened there . ” she was not allowed to venture outside without a veil over her face and a male relative at her side . night after night , the children were jolted awake by the sound of fighter jets screaming overhead . “ my kids would wake up even if it was only raining , ” amal says . “ everything was terrible . isis was all around us . ” by september 2014 , the foursome was on the run again , inside a bus bound for the lebanese border . the kids haven ’ t seen a classroom for nearly two years . their mom has never been to school . not for one day . described as a “ homemaker ” in her canadian paperwork , amal earns zero income in lebanon , and her family survives largely on the kindness of others , including some siblings who live nearby . until recently , she and the kids lived with one of her sisters , but they were evicted after failing to pay the monthly rent ( 250 , 000 lebanese dollars , or about us$170 ) . “ i try my best every day to not let the children go to bed without food , ” amal says . “ but sometimes . . . ” the old cellphone she has was a gift from a friend , a hand - me - down . the screen was already shattered when she got it . her lifeline to the outside world ( especially the unhcr ) , amal pays us$10 a month to keep it on . although millions of syrians have registered with the un refugee agency , only a meagre fraction will be resettled in the west . when countries like canada do decide to offer up space , the unhcr recommends the most vulnerable , desperate cases : refugees with severe health problems . torture victims . poor , single mothers like amal alkhalaf . it was way back in december 2014—nine months before alan kurdi drowned , and when stephen harper was still prime minister—when she received the cellphone call that would change their lives . it was the embassy , informing her that canada was considering them for resettlement . “ i can ’ t describe how happy i was , ” she says . “ but at the same time i was sad because i didn ’ t know how long i would have to wait . one year ? two years ? god knows . ” eleven months , it turned out . the embassy called back in early november 2015 ( only a couple of weeks before the suicide bombings ) to invite her for an interview . “ the children talk about canada a lot , ” amal says . “ ‘are we going to have our own house ? is there no war ? are we going to have an established life ? ’ that is their dream . ” asked where she ’ d like to live , amal is quick to respond . “ i will stay at the canadian border , ” she says . “ the most important thing is that i reach canada . if they told me now to go the airport , i would grab my children and go to the airport . ” until today , amal has no idea that private citizens are working so hard on her behalf . she has never heard of the “ blended ” sponsorship program , and peterborough may as well be mars . when maclean ’ s explains where she ’ s going and how she ’ ll get there , amal seems overwhelmed , as if it can ’ t possibly be true . “ i want to thank them one and two and three and four and five times , as much as i can , ” she smiles , placing a hand over her heart . “ they are going to take me out of this swamp and i will see the world again , and they will offer education for my kids . ” if maclean ’ s found this woman , the peterborough group asked the reporter to pass along two things : an envelope containing some money , and a small token of their friendship and commitment—four miniature pins depicting the canadian flag , one for each of them . amal unwraps the tissue paper and picks up one of the red and white flags , turning it in her fingertips . “ this is like a trophy for me , ” she says , looking up . “ it is an honour to get the flag . i don ’ t know how i can express my thanks . i don ’ t know how i can express my feelings . ” the children lean in to see the gifts . “ i am going to put this in my heart , ” amal continues . “ i am proud . ” before saying goodbye , the woman asks maclean ’ s to deliver something of hers to the group : her cell number . “ i hope god gives me the time to meet them , ” she says . six days later , dec . 9 , the peterborough sponsors have a meeting scheduled , the perfect chance for a first phone call with amal . they ask serout , their new volunteer translator , to contact her in advance and ask if 7 p . m . works . of course , she says . it will be 2 a . m . in beirut , but she ’ s happy to huddle in her kitchen while everyone else is asleep . by now , salaam peterborough has another co - sponsor , its fourteenth . an environmental sciences professor at trent university , tom whillans dropped in at the new canadians centre the other day , hoping to find information about a group he could join . “ it ’ s an extremely important issue , ” he says . “ and it ’ s not just about donating money to a cause . the personal contact is really , really important . ” he ’ s known rick and lise casually for many years ( tom helps run a music festival rick plays in ) and when he noticed their names on a list , he knew where to go . tom knocked on their door . when they weren ’ t home , he came back another time . “ that is the peterborough we know , ” says lise , herself a trent graduate . “ that may sound sappy , but there are so many people like that in this community . ” ‘who is doing this for me ? ’ amal asked the group membersas 7 o ’ clock approaches , they gather in rick and lise ’ s kitchen . most of the group is here , huddled around the same island where lise and stephanie prepped all those slow - cooker recipes three months ago . rick is holding claire , the couple ’ s three - year - old . serout is sitting on a stool in the middle of the pack , his cell on speakerphone . “ allo , ” amal answers . for weeks , these men and women have thought of little else than this person on the other end of the phone . to suddenly hear her voice is almost a relief . kristy takes a deep breath , holding back tears . like lise and carla , myra can ’ t stop smiling . phung places a hand over her mouth . “ hello from canada , ” they say in unison , followed by “ marhaba , ” arabic for hello . “ marhaba , ” amal answers . everyone laughs . speaking through serout , amal thanks the strangers for their money and their kindness . but even with the language barrier , the group can sense her desperation . she doesn ’ t sound anywhere near as optimistic as she did just a few days ago , when maclean ’ s met her in lebanon . “ my situation is really bad , ” she says , beginning to cry . serout tries to reassure her . “ be patient , be strong , ” he says . “ everything is going to be ok . ” “ inshallah , ” she says . god willing . amal is especially worried about her family ’ s medical tests , the final step before boarding an airplane . it ’ s been more than a month since her interview with a canadian visa officer , yet she ’ s heard nothing about a doctor ’ s appointment . “ you don ’ t know how i live here , ” she tells the group . “ it ’ s like a grave . ” serout asks amal if she needs the sponsors to prepare anything specific for her arrival . “ nothing , nothing , ” she says . “ i only want to get out of here . i want my kids to see a new life and i want them to forget this sad life they have been in . just one hour here is too long . ” near the end of the call , amal asks a question : “ who is doing this for me ? ” a collection of families , serout replies , explaining how the sponsorship group will cover her family ’ s first year of expenses in canada . “ they don ’ t care if you are a muslim or not a muslim , ” he says . “ at last , we are humanity , ” amal answers . “ there is no black or white . ” as wonderful as it is to finally hear amal ’ s voice , the phone call is unexpectedly deflating . the group assumed all the hurdles had been cleared , including the medicals . listening to her break down only sharpens their resolve to get the family to canada . the next morning , dec . 10 , lise fires off an email to aspa ’ s main contact in immigration , asking about the medicals , but hears nothing back . later that evening , justin trudeau is at pearson international airport , welcoming the first planeload of syrian refugees to touch down . “ i was awake in the middle of the night , so i got up , ” lise says . “ carla had mentioned to me that there is some kind of website where you can check the status of your application , and sure enough , up pops this notice that says the government has been waiting for amal to take her medical since oct . 7 . ” she messages serout , who phones amal again . somehow , the oct . 7 notice never reached her . a few phone calls later , and the exams are booked . “ if we hadn ’ t been able to talk to her , we wouldn ’ t have had a clue that any of this was going on , ” lise says . “ she would still be sitting there . ” the news arrives on christmas afternoon , via serout . amal and the children have been told to be at beirut ’ s airport on dec . 28 , bright and early—three months to the day after being matched with the people from peterborough . “ get ready for your christmas gift , ” lise writes to the others on facebook . “ they are coming on the 29th ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ” when the 28th arrives , amal and the kids board a flight to jordan , their first ever ride on an airplane . ( “ i was really , really scared , ” she would later say . ) from there , the plan is to take a chartered jet directly to pearson , but it ’ s delayed . by the time they finally board , they ’ re 15 hours behind schedule—pushing back their arrival by one day , to dec . 30 . in peterborough , meanwhile , the sponsors have heard nothing official from ottawa . if amal wasn ’ t communicating with serout , the group would have no clue the flight was delayed . thanks to aspa , lise has a number for an airport employee who does know one thing : after landing , syrian refugees are being bused to a nearby hotel . the pickup crew , 90 minutes away , takes a calculated gamble : better to wait at that hotel than in peterborough , assuming amal will show up at some point . members of the sponsorship group meet the children for the first time at an airport hotelthey steer into the parking lot just before 5 : 30 p . m . on dec . 30 , split between two passenger vans : stephanie , lise , paulette , lee - anne , serout and tom ( the trent prof , not the retired engineer ) . a friend of dave ’ s , who owns a shuttle company , offered the vans ( and the two drivers ) as a donation . dave and kristy are not here tonight . they had booked a christmas trip long ago , and couldn ’ t cancel . although her emotions are mixed , kristy is thrilled beyond words that her facebook post has led to this moment . “ i love that we are such a team , ” she says . “ i think we ’ ll look back in 10 or 15 years , and this will be a very positive chapter in canada ’ s story , ” her husband adds . the group members mingle in the hotel lobby , watching as a busload of refugees , utterly exhausted , walk through the front entrance . “ welcome to canada , ” lee - anne says , hugging one woman . the retired major is holding a small canadian flag . her sister has a bouquet of flowers , red and white . as 6 p . m . approaches , another bus pulls up . serout sees them first . “ they ’ re here ! ” he yells . “ they ’ re here ! ” paulette repeats , rushing outside . “ oh my gosh , ” says stephanie , following lise and lee - anne to the door . amal flashes a wide smile as paulette wraps her arms around her shoulders , then reaches for the children , one by one . lee - anne is right behind her , amal ’ s next hug . she is wearing the same checkered hijab as she did that day in bourj el - barajneh—just 27 days ago . after two days of travel , the family finally arrives in peterborough , excited but exhausted “ are you dalya ? ” stephanie asks , smiling at the little girl . she turned nine on dec . 20 . in between hugs , lise tries not to cry . jingle bell rock is playing on the loudspeakers . tom and serout collect the family ’ s suitcases from under the bus as everyone heads to the lobby . ottawa has also provided care packages , giving each child a new winter jacket , boots , gloves and a toque . serout rips off the tag of dalya ’ s pink coat and helps her put it on . beside her , ibrahim waves lee - anne ’ s canadian flag . pinned to ansam ’ s jacket is the maple leaf the group sent to her in lebanon , via maclean ’ s . “ it is like a dream , ” amal says , now holding the bouquet of flowers . “ i am so happy just to be here safe . ” ‘i didn ’ t feel like a stranger at all . i felt at home . it ’ s like i knew these people a long time ago . ’ the three children climb into the back row of one of the vans while serout and amal take the two middle seats . a few minutes later , the caravan is merging onto highway 401 , heading east amid a sea of headlights . “ are we going to live here forever ? ” dalya asks . “ yes , ” serout answers . nineteen years ago , a young maryam monsef made a similar nighttime drive to peterborough . she didn ’ t speak english , and she had yet to meet sister ruth . today , monsef is a federal cabinet minister . “ that makes me feel like my kids have a good future , ” amal says , looking at the heavy traffic out her window . “ i can see it and i can feel it . the most important thing for me is that everybody is a human being and everybody gets respected and treated the same way . it doesn ’ t matter what religion or colour you are . ” it was heartbreaking , amal says , to leave her relatives—including the sister - in - law and kids who shared her apartment—but she hopes to one day help them get here , too . “ from what i ’ ve seen so far , canada is going to be even better than my imagination , ” she continues . “ i ’ m not asking for much . i just want my kids to be safe , to go to school , to have food . that is all i need . ” in the other van , lee - anne passes around some christmas chocolates . in between bites , she tells the others that what they just accomplished is as gratifying as anything she did in afghanistan . “ it is absolutely equivalent , without a doubt , ” she says . “ if we can sit here in this vehicle , in this country , and save somebody ’ s life , that is just as good as me being three oceans away saving somebody ’ s life . ” in the front seat , professor tom says amal ’ s family has just won the equivalent of a lottery . “ you also feel like it ’ s a lottery for us—that we were lucky enough to be born here , ” he says . “ we didn ’ t do anything to earn that . ” lee - anne tucks ibrahim into bed as dalya watches . in lebanon , the family slept on a floor . it is almost 9 : 30 p . m . when the vans steer into the driveway . the children are fast asleep , oblivious to the christmas lights hanging from some of the houses . amal is wearing a pair of ballet - style flats , no match for the snow she steps in as she exits the vehicle . phung , standing in the dark driveway , gives her a hug . when the kids emerge , drowsy and dazed , she squeezes them , too . she can ’ t help but wonder what her own mother was thinking all those decades ago . the group managed to secure a granny flat for the family , a temporary home until they find something more permanent . it could not be more inviting . the fridge is overflowing . a cake on the kitchen table says : “ welcome to canada . ” pieces of children ’ s artwork are hanging everywhere . “ we are so glad you are here , ” one says . “ you are loved , ” reads another . “ there is lots and lots of food , ” lise says . “ i don ’ t know how to thank you , ” says amal , still smiling . “ we are just very glad that you are here , ” lise replies . the children are so tired that they ’ re falling asleep sitting up , their jackets still zipped . phung leads ibrahim to the bedroom and puts him under the covers , while paulette and lee - anne show amal how to use the pull - out couch . the others start lacing up their shoes , knowing the family needs some space . “ i didn ’ t realize this was going to happen , ” amal says , thanking them one more time . “ this is more than enough . ” until their first morning in canada , the children had never touched snowthe next morning is new year ’ s eve . when serout stops by for a visit , arriving a few minutes after 9 o ’ clock , he doesn ’ t need to knock . everyone inside is wide awake . dalya was up at 6 a . m . , staring out the large bay window that overlooks the backyard . “ when i woke up , i felt i was in a dream , ” amal says . “ i told ibrahim to come to see the snow but he didn ’ t believe me . he thought i was making a joke . ” four weeks ago , this family woke up on the floor of that windowless living room in lebanon , too afraid to even venture outside . today , ibrahim is immersed in a lego set , almost finished piecing it together . a cartoon , super why , fills the flat - screen television that sits atop an electric fireplace . ansam is on the couch , reading about each of her new sponsors . ( the group prepared information sheets with photos and brief biographies , in english and arabic . ) dalya is still perched on the windowsill , gazing out . the group left behind two new ipads on the kitchen counter , with an itunes gift card to match . amal says there ’ s another gift card , too , pointing to the name on serout ’ s coffee cup ( tim hortons ) . she will learn . “ i cannot describe the life here compared to where i was , ” she says . “ it ’ s like from hell to heaven . ” not every day will be so euphoric . adjusting to the pace and culture of a new country is an overwhelming journey , even for the most grateful refugee , and as the weeks go by , amal and her children will no doubt endure some darker emotions than they feel right now . serout remembers his own family ’ s experience ; at one point , they considered returning to their tent in syria because they found it so hard to acclimatize to canada . “ we were going crazy , to be honest , ” he says . ‘canada is going to be even better than my imagination . i want my kids to be safe , to go to school ’ real life lies ahead . dentist appointments . health care applications . first day of school . amal has never learned to read or write , and as excited as she is to tackle english ( “ to learn canadian , ” as she says ) , the road will be long and challenging . even this gorgeous granny flat—full of bright sunlight and fresh paint and a shiny bathroom—is temporary . with the group ’ s help , amal must start looking for a place she can afford once the sponsorship support runs dry next year . a job ? that ’ s listed on the resettlement plan , too . near the door , the kids start zipping up their jackets and sliding on their boots . amal tugs on dalya ’ s knit hat , ensuring it covers her ears . “ go play as much as you want because we are going to be here one week and then they are going to send us back , ” amal jokes . “ they ’ re not going to send us back ! ” her daughter replies . a wooden deck leads to a large backyard , where a motorboat is covered with a plastic tarp . ansam ’ s boots crunch through a thin layer of icy snow , a sound as canadian as any . “ only in pictures , ” she says , when asked if she has ever seen snow before . standing on the deck , amal watches as a snowball fight ensues . she is still digesting the events of last night , strangers running to hug her . “ i didn ’ t feel like a stranger at all , ” she says . “ i basically felt at home . it ’ s like i knew these people a long time ago . ” paulette the french teacher pulls into the driveway . “ hello , hello , ” she says . “ you look so nice in your new coats ! ” all three kids get another hug . carrying a jug of road salt , paulette immediately starts sprinkling the deck . “ i noticed it was slippery last night , ” she says . amal watches , not quite sure what to think . paulette ’ s first job today is to take the family to the mall so they can buy a new cellphone . amal ’ s old one—the hand - me - down with the shattered screen—is long gone . “ i threw it in the garbage at the airport , ” she smiles . reporter : michael friscolantieditor : dianna symonds and alison unclesdirector of photography : liz sullivanart director : stephen gregorydigital production editor : amanda shendrukvideo producer : kayla chobotiuk , michael friscolanti , and liz sullivanphotographers : cole garside and sam tarlingvideographers : afp , getty , cole garside and sam tarlingvideo editor : kayla chobotiukpublished : january 13 , 2016
__label__relevant saving family no . 417 amal alkhalaf and her children ( dalya , 8 ; ansam , 13 ; ibrahim , 10 ) escaped isis - controlled territory in syria in 2014the journey of one syrian mother , her three children—and the complete strangers who made it their mission to bring them to canada . by michael friscolanti , in beirut , lebanon and peterborough , ontariothe first martyr came by motorcycle , weaving through a concrete maze of narrow roads and low - rise apartments . his final destination—his supposed gateway to paradise—was a residential market district brimming with civilians . when the bike exploded , ripping through coffee shops and clothing racks , a second suicide bomber unleashed an encore . even before islamic state claimed responsibility , the motive was obvious . the target—bourj el - barajneh , one of beirut ’ s congested southern suburbs—is hezbollah turf , a largely shia district in lebanon . across the border in war - torn syria , hezbollah is fighting alongside bashar al - assad ’ s forces , battling mostly sunni insurgents , isis included . the market massacre ( 47 dead ) was yet another volley . the very next night , nov . 13 , islamic state terrorists struck again—in downtown paris . if canadians had even heard about the carnage in beirut , it was quickly forgotten . three weeks later , a woman is standing in the same street market . a sunni muslim , she is wearing a checkered hijab , green and black , and holding tightly to the hand of her eight - year - old daughter . all around them , there is little evidence left of the damage . the charred debris that littered the intersection was promptly shovelled away , and a fresh coat of paint covers the cement facade that endured the brunt of the attacks . afternoon shoppers criss - cross the road as if nothing happened here , walking underneath dangling webs of wires that zigzag from balcony to balcony . “ i have not been outside since the explosion , ” the woman says , speaking arabic . “ if you didn ’ t call me to meet you , i wouldn ’ t have come outside . it is too scary . ” her name is amal alkhalaf , and although she doesn ’ t realize it yet , that name alone means so much to so many . on the other side of the world—in peterborough , ont . , a city that could not be further away from the armed checkpoints that surround bourj el - barajneh—a group of strangers has made it their mission to sponsor her family and bring them to canada , despite never seeing her face or hearing her voice . all they know is her name , and that she and her three kids , living somewhere in lebanon , are among the many millions of syrian refugees who fled for their lives . the people in peterborough have no idea that this woman and her children , two girls and a boy , escaped isis territory 14 months ago , only to have islamic state ’ s violence follow them to lebanon . they don ’ t know that the kids have not been to school in nearly two years . “ i worry about them constantly , ” says kristy hiltz , a veterinarian who spearheaded the sponsorship group . “ i really hope they know that somebody out there is already very attached to them . ” in countless ways , syria ’ s humanitarian crisis has brought out the very best in canadians , even before justin trudeau ’ s liberals swept to power on a campaign promise to welcome 25 , 000 refugees in record time . a single , sickening image—a three - year - old boy dead on a beach , when british columbia could have been home—became a nationwide rallying cry . hundreds of private sponsorship groups mobilized in a matter of days , each one determined to rescue the next alan kurdi . this is the story of one of those groups—a collection of 14 everyday canadians motivated by the same , simple goal as all the groups : to do what ’ s right . to do something . this is a story about a facebook post , and the wide cast of characters who answered the challenge . a story about teachers and scientists and a jewish dance instructor who didn ’ t hesitate to donate time and money . a story about professors . a cop . a blues musician . an engineer . a decorated soldier . a vietnamese boat person determined to pay forward the generosity that saved her own family . this is a story about a city ( population 79 , 000 ) that has a long , quiet history of welcoming refugees . a city where the newly elected mp was herself a refugee—but a city that also made global headlines after someone , post - paris , firebombed its only mosque . more than anything , though , this is a story about a woman with a name , a resilient but frightened single mother who has no idea her canadian sponsors even exist—until this december afternoon , when maclean ’ s tracks her down in beirut ’ s notorious southern suburbs . amal alkhalaf only knows that she and her children have been accepted for resettlement , nothing more . she has certainly never heard of a place called peterborough . david mcnab has a nickname for his wife of 23 years : the freight train of enthusiasm . when kristy hiltz puts her mind to something , in other words , don ’ t even think about standing in her tracks . the moniker fits dave just as well . “ we tend to look at things in terms of : ‘how can we help ? ’ ” he says . “ or at least we try to . ” their own marriage is proof of the couple ’ s devotion to seeing things through . dave met kristy during a jamaican vacation , and they embarked on a long - distance love when both returned to their homes ( kristy to peterborough ; dave to his ontario provincial police posting in haileybury , five hours north ) . although const . mcnab did secure a transfer to bancroft ( only 100 km from his fiancée ) , another 18 months would pass—including seven as husband and wife—before the couple lived under the same roof . dave has been stationed in peterborough ever since . ninety minutes northeast of toronto , peterborough is known as “ the electric city ” because it was the first in canada to use electric streetlights ( 1884 ) . the community ’ s official name dates back to peter robinson , a politician who oversaw the region ’ s first major immigration wave in 1825 : the arrival of 2 , 000 irish - catholic farmers . today , the population remains overwhelmingly white ( fewer than four per cent are visible minorities ) and increasingly elderly . add in the surrounding townships , and nearly one in five is a senior . ask the locals what they treasure most—besides the petes , the junior hockey team that has produced a long list of nhlers—and two answers top the list : the city ’ s small - town feel , and the kindness of neighbours . one recent survey asked residents to rank what they love about peterborough . “ we are a caring community ” was the no . 1 response . ‘i worry about them constantly ’ dave and kristy raised their three kids in the rural countryside of millbrook , a neighbouring township where the children displayed their own caring side in the early 2000s . members of a group called “ kids 4 turtles ” lobbied local politicians to erect traffic signs on country roads , warning drivers to watch out for the little reptiles crossing the street . mom , the freight train of enthusiasm , later helped launch the kawartha turtle trauma centre , where , to this day , injured turtles are rehabilitated and released . dave caught some grief from fellow officers ( “ f–k , dave . turtles ? ” one sergeant razzed him ) but not anymore . “ i still get texts from people saying : ‘hey , i saved a turtle , ’ ” he laughs . like so many around the world , kristy was repulsed when she first saw the photo : a lifeless little boy , face down on the shore of a turkish resort . alan kurdi resembled anyone ’ s precious toddler , dressed in blue shorts and a red t - shirt . “ it was too much , ” says the 51 - year - old . “ i don ’ t know how else to say it . ” in an instant , one photo awakened the world to a refugee crisis that had been unfolding in plain sight for four years . in canada—where the federal election campaign was in full throttle—horror turned to outrage after a report that the boy ’ s aunt , a hairdresser in port coquitlam , b . c . , had applied to sponsor the family of alan ’ s uncle , with the hope of one day sponsoring alan ’ s family , too . after ottawa rejected his brother ’ s application , alan ’ s father hatched a far more dangerous plan : piling his family into a motorboat bound for the greek island of kos . along with alan , the mediterranean sea swallowed his five - year - old brother , galib , and their mother , rehana . on sept . 4 , the friday before labour day weekend , kristy posted alan ’ s photo on her facebook feed . “ this child and his family should be alive in canada today , ” she wrote . “ canada , and the rest of the world , needs to step up to help refugees , or their blood is on our hands . ” like so many , kristy hiltz was horrified : ‘this child and his family should be alive in canada ’ if statistics told the entire story , ottawa was not exactly ignoring the plight of syrian refugees . last january , eight months before alan died , stephen harper ’ s conservatives announced a plan to resettle 10 , 000 displaced syrians over the next three years ( after already welcoming 1 , 300 under a previous promise ) . but in the eyes of many canadians , that was hardly enough . from coast to coast , frontline organizations that assist immigrants and refugees couldn ’ t answer the ringing telephones fast enough . among those flooded with voicemails was the new canadians centre ( ncc ) , a peterborough settlement agency that offers everything from language training to job counselling . “ people were asking : ‘what are you guys doing ? what can we do ? ’ ” says tamara hoogerdyk of the ncc . “ so we thought , ‘well , we have to take the lead on this . ’ ” staff scrambled to organize a sponsorship workshop on sept . 10 , one week after the image hit the internet . more than 70 people showed up , including kristy hiltz . “ i went to hear what they had to say . and i thought : ‘we can do this . we can totally do this . ’ ” a crisis negotiator , dave was deployed out of town at the time . kristy dialled his cell . “ she was very excited , ” he remembers . “ the idea , to me , seemed terrific , although intimidating . but the more i talked to kristy , the more it just made sense . ” dave himself is an immigrant , coming from scotland as a toddler . the following day , sept . 11 , kristy posted another facebook message to her 300 - plus friends . “ dave and i want to co - sponsor a refugee , individual or family , ” she wrote . “ we are looking for people who would be willing to co - sponsor with us . ” the plan was for each volunteer to donate money ( at least $500 per person , or $1 , 000 per couple ) and one year of time and energy . for a brief moment , kristy felt extremely vulnerable . what if nobody responded ? myra hirschberg was born and raised in new york city , the granddaughter of eastern european jews who immigrated to the united states in the early 20th century . from a young age , she understood— “ breathed in , ” as she puts it—the importance of helping those less fortunate . “ it is an inherent part of the jewish religion : to share what you have with others , ” she says . “ it ’ s true of every religion i ’ m familiar with , including islam . ” ‘there is actually something we can do that is going to make a difference ’ her true passion is dancing—contra - dancing , in particular . it ’ s sort of like square dancing , except it ’ s done in lines . now in her 60s , myra has travelled all over north america to teach others the steps . it ’ s how she met her canadian husband , tom calwell , an aerospace engineer . “ we were at a dance week in west virginia , ” she recalls . the couple retired to peterborough , where kristy hiltz is their veterinarian . “ the plight of refugees was all over the news , and i had been spending days feeling completely helpless to do anything concrete , ” myra says . “ when kristy posted that message it was like : ‘there is actually something we can do that is going to make a difference in somebody ’ s life . ’ ” her husband was immediately on board . “ i was feeling as a country we were getting a really bad rep , ” tom says , “ and i wanted to do anything positive . ” ‘their names and ages—that ’ s all we know ’ lise fines didn ’ t hesitate , either . a grade 7 teacher at st . paul ’ s elementary school , she and her husband , rick , first met kristy more than a decade ago , when she performed two surgeries , free of charge , on their ailing dog . “ we always think : ‘who do we want our three - year - old daughter to become , and how is she going to learn that ? ’ ” says lise , 46 . “ i wanted her to see that this is what we can do if someone needs our help . ” she and rick , a blues and folk musician , sat down to hammer out a payment plan . “ i imagine myself there and how hopeless it would feel , ” says rick , 53 . two days later , lise was chopping away in her kitchen beside a close friend , stephanie melles , an ecology professor at ryerson university . melles ’ s research specialty is ecoinformatics ( an emerging field that integrates stats and engineering into the study of ecosystems ) , but on that sunday afternoon , the task at hand was a bit less complicated : prepping slow - cooker meals for the freezer , from mongolian beef to green chili pork . as lise and stephanie sliced and measured , the conversation turned to syrian refugees . like lise , stephanie has a three - year - old , and the photo of alan hit close to home . “ it almost looked like he was sleeping , ” she says . some of her ryerson colleagues were already working to sponsor syrians , but because stephanie commutes to toronto , she wouldn ’ t have been much help to a family resettling near campus . lise had a better idea : she put her in touch with kristy . “ steph jumped on it right away , ” says her husband , trevor middel , a fisheries biologist . the group takes shapetop row : dance teacher myra hirschberg , french teacher paulette quinn , and nurse practitioner and retired canadian forces major lee - anne quinn . middle row : retired engineer tom calwell , grade 7 teacher carla gorman , and fisheries biologist trevor middel . bottom row : grade 7 teacher lise fines , musician rick fines , and ecology professor stephanie melles . the group was quickly taking shape : kristy and dave ( the vet and the cop ) . myra and tom ( the dancer and the engineer ) . rick and lise ( the musician and the teacher ) . trevor and stephanie ( the biologist and the prof ) . lise—herself a freight train of enthusiasm—recruited another co - sponsor with no previous connection to kristy or dave : paulette quinn , the french teacher at st . paul ’ s . one of eight brothers and sisters , the 59 - year - old is always fundraising for one school cause or another . “ sometimes all you can do is send some money somewhere , ” she says . “ but this was really getting involved in bringing a family over and looking after that family . ” one of paulette ’ s younger sisters , lee - anne quinn , lives right across the street , and every night after supper they head out for a walk . during one september stroll , she told lee - anne about the group , knowing full well her sibling would jump to join . “ that ’ s just the kind of person lee - anne is , ” paulette says . not that lee - anne would ever say so . “ she ’ s very discrete , ” paulette says , putting it mildly . when asked about herself , lee - anne is accurate but brief . a nurse practitioner , she served 23 years in the canadian forces , including four tours ( in the former yugoslavia , somalia , rwanda and afghanistan ) . maj . quinn ’ s family had no doubt she would join the military ; even as a young girl , she was ultra - organized , ensuring the others folded their clothes and made their beds . her kandahar deployment ( 2007 - 08 ) was an eight - month whirlwind at the multinational hospital , where she helped treat a constant influx of battlefield casualties . more than once , she held the hand of a canadian soldier as he took his final breaths . “ it ’ s actually a privilege to be in that position , ” she says . some days , lee - anne would set up a clinic in a desolate patch of the country , where local women and children had never seen a medical professional before . “ i don ’ t live in ignorance , ” she says . “ i know there are some desperate corners of our world out there , and when you see it , you really get a sense of appreciation for what canada has to offer . ” maj . quinn retired in 2008 , never thinking twice about where her next posting would be : back home . “ when the sponsorship project was presented to me i thought : ‘wow , being retired military , i can still make a difference for people who live so far away , ’ ” she says . “ it ’ s quite humbling , actually . ” lee - anne neglects to mention how she volunteered to serve three stints as the only health - care provider in a remote first nations community , where her work with children—including building an outdoor rink , and convincing the nhl players association to fly in sticks , pucks and skates—earned her the nightingale award as ontario ’ s top nurse . her order of military merit , the canadian forces ’ equivalent to the order of canada ? she doesn ’ t bring that up , either . paulette does . “ that is not important today , ” lee - anne says . “ what ’ s important today is getting a family to safety . ” from the outside , there is nothing unique about the brick house with the arched front door . it blends right in with all the other homes on this residential road near downtown peterborough . a nun answers the doorbell , wearing black pants and a violet sweater . “ welcome , ” she says . it is not the first time—nor the last—sister ruth hennessey has uttered that reassuring word to someone standing on her front porch . all these years later , sister ruth still marvels at how she ended up here , living in a bedroom upstairs while so many refugees come and go on the two floors below . a teacher for nearly four decades , she is part of the local sisters of st . joseph , a congregation that started opening its motherhouse to refugees in the 1990s . demand soon trumped capacity . “ one summer i was asked to find a house , ” she says . “ this one was in a good neighbourhood and it had a basement apartment . ” they called the property casa maria . the nuns went on to buy two other homes , providing temporary accommodation to more than 150 refugee families since 1994 . “ i have such faith in these people that come to us , ” says sister ruth , now in her late 70s . “ they are good people—wonderful people . ” she has chronicled each one , their photos filling numerous albums spread out on the dining room table . among the smiling faces is a 12 - year - old girl from afghanistan—maryam monsef—who came to casa maria , with her mother and two sisters , in the spring of 1996 . they lived in the basement apartment . “ she didn ’ t speak a word of english , ” sister ruth recalls , flipping through the photographs . “ they had nothing when they arrived here . ” how things would change . peterborough ’ s newly elected liberal mp , maryam monsef , arrived in canada as a refugeewhen kristy hiltz posted her facebook challenge , monsef , now 30 , was running as the local liberal candidate in the federal election . her eventual victory made her the first afghan - born mp , and her cabinet post ( minister of democratic institutions ) marked another historic first . “ maryam would always say : ‘i ’ m going to make you proud of me , ’ ” sister ruth recalls . “ and i would say : ‘i ’ ve always been proud of you . ’ ” most of the refugees who funnel through casa maria are not sponsored ; they manage to get to canada on their own , then file asylum claims . a few times a year , however , casa maria does apply to sponsor a specific refugee living overseas . “ the process is very , very slow , ” sister ruth says . “ but once this little boy ’ s picture was shown across the world , people came alive and wanted to do something . ” she knew exactly where to point all those motivated people : aspa bouzinelos . years from now , when peterborough has a thriving community of syrian - canadians , aspa will be a major reason why . ‘we have to be there for them , walk with them ’ a longtime member of casa maria ’ s advisory board ( and a greek immigrant who teaches english as a second language ) , aspa had just taken the reins of another volunteer position : the sponsorship agreement holder ( sah ) rep at the roman catholic diocese of peterborough . numbering nearly 100 across canada , a sah is an organization approved by ottawa as a trusted partner in refugee resettlement . ranging from the salvation army to the mennonite central committee , sahs can either sponsor refugees directly or allow groups to apply under their umbrella . simply put , it is infinitely easier for a new group to work with a sah ; processing times are much faster , and approval rates much higher . “ people started phoning and asking if they could meet , ” aspa says . the calls still haven ’ t stopped ; at last count , the diocese is working with 35 sponsorship groups in the peterborough area . “ i manage , ” aspa smiles . “ i go home at night and respond to all the emails . ” when she sat down with kristy ’ s group for the first time , on sunday , sept . 20 , it was the fourth group she ’ d met that day . ‘it just really struck a chord with me ’ they gathered in the living room at casa maria : kristy , dave , myra , tom , stephanie and lise . sister ruth poured coffee for the guests as aspa explained the basics . although most groups sponsor a friend or relative of someone already in canada , there is another stream—the “ blended visa office - referred , ” or bvor—in which ottawa matches groups with vulnerable families recommended for resettlement by the united nations refugee agency . under that program , ottawa covers six months of income support ( up to $13 , 500 ) while the group pays the other six months ( hence the term “ blended ” ) . but there is one major downside to the program : cases are extremely rare . by the time kristy ’ s group convened at casa maria , only 29 syrian refugees had arrived under the bvor stream since the beginning of 2014 . nevertheless , everyone at the meeting was optimistic that somehow , some way , they ’ d be matched with a family who needed their help . it happened before , after all . one of the group ’ s own members—phung tran , sitting with the others that sunday—was living proof . there was no internet back then . no twitter . no medium for a single photo to spread across the globe in a matter of minutes . but when those black - and - white images hit front pages in 1979—tens of thousands of indochinese refugees , fleeing communism on flimsy , overcrowded boats—the reaction was equally visceral : canadians needed to help . prime minister joe clark responded with a now - historic pledge , vowing to open canada ’ s doors to 50 , 000 boat people over the next 18 months ( a target later boosted to 60 , 000 ) . more than half would end up being privately sponsored—including 11 who landed in the small town of sussex , n . b . , their resettlement paid for by the parishioners of st . paul ’ s united church . “ we had to raise $12 , 000 , ” recalls daniel keith , the church ’ s clerk of the session at the time . “ amongst the congregation , everyone just ponied up . ” the newcomers included a young family airlifted out of a malaysian refugee camp : loc and chu tran , and their 18 - month - old daughter , phung . daniel ’ s daughter , mary , first met the trans in the church nursery . mary was pregnant with her second daughter , as was chu . “ chu looked across the room at me and i saw her hand slide down her stomach , ” says mary , now 65 . “ i thought to myself : ‘she is pregnant . ’ i can still remember that moment , and i often think about how that gesture bridged the whole cultural divide . ” it also marked the beginning of a lifelong bond between the trans and the keiths . they are family now , not friends . a teacher back in south vietnam , phung ’ s father quickly found work at a refrigeration company , then at a poultry plant . in between shifts , he took english classes—in saint john , 70 km away . ( parishioners volunteered to drive him back and forth . ) when he and chu were busy at work , loc would often ask if daniel and his wife , ann , could babysit . they never refused . “ my mother was a very kind person , but she didn ’ t let people into her life easily , ” mary says . “ she did completely in this case . she just loved those children dearly . ” phung and her baby sister , lea , spent so much time at the keith home that they came to consider ann and daniel their “ canadian grandparents . ” mary still has photos of the tran girls playing with her daughters , frances and eliza . “ they enriched our lives so much , ” she says , her voice cracking . “ helping this family was probably the most gratifying thing i ’ ve ever done in my life . ” after nearly four years in new brunswick , loc and chu made the difficult decision to move their family to toronto , 1 , 500 km away . though grateful to everyone at st . paul ’ s , especially the keiths , they felt ontario offered the best future . “ it was sad for us , ” says daniel , now 94 . “ loc was just like a brother to me . ” despite the distance , the families never lost touch . the keiths followed from afar as loc and chu , both employed at a duck farm , reaped the benefits of their hard work . they bought a home in suburban newmarket , put their kids through post - secondary school , and saved enough for a comfortable retirement . “ in some ways , i think they ’ re still in shock , ” phung , now 38 , says of her parents . “ they have a little house here on pigeon lake , just outside of peterborough . and their kids have houses now . ” a graduate of trent university , phung is a biologist with the ontario ministry of natural resources , where she works on species - at - risk legislation . she met her husband , fellow biologist brad steinberg , while conducting field research at algonquin park . they have a son , jack . when their daughter was born two years ago , they named her annie—in honour of phung ’ s “ canadian grandmother . ” sadly , ann was in a nursing home by then , suffering from late - stage alzheimer ’ s disease . “ it brought tears to my eyes , ” daniel says , remembering the first time he heard the baby ’ s name . “ i tried to tell my wife , but i don ’ t know if she could take it in . ” ann keith died on dec . 2 , 2014 , shortly after her 66th wedding anniversary . a few months later , phung received a letter in the mail—with a cheque from ann ’ s estate . ann had inherited some money late in life , and before alzheimer ’ s clouded her mind , she crafted a will that ensured all her loved ones , the trans included , received a share . phung was so surprised that she phoned mary in new brunswick to make sure it wasn ’ t a mistake . “ i didn ’ t know if i deserved it , ” she says . “ i was stunned . ” it ’ s what mom wanted , mary assured her . “ it confirmed that she felt we were her grandkids , too , ” phung says . ‘it ’ s part of my life . it ’ s part of my story . ’ she and brad invested some of ann ’ s money in the kids ’ resps , but weren ’ t quite sure what to do with the rest . then phung read kristy ’ s facebook post . “ when the photo of alan kurdi was all over the place , it was pretty tough for me , ” she says . “ there is always that sense of guilt : ‘why did i make it when so many others didn ’ t ? ’ ” phung and brad knew exactly what to do , pledging $1 , 000—and their time and energy—toward kristy ’ s group . “ this was a way for phung to sort of pay it forward , ” brad says . “ someone 35 years ago—strangers—brought her family over , and for us to be able to do the same thing was pretty important . ” a perfect tribute to ann ’ s memory . for phung , joining the group also provided something else : the motivation to learn more about her own story . she was too young to remember her family ’ s harrowing boat ride to malaysia , and her parents have shared few details . “ we had to make the decisions we had to make , ” was the extent of their answer , whenever she asked . “ this whole experience has given me that push , that opportunity , to talk about these things and ask my parents questions without feeling awkward or out of place , ” she says . “ it ’ s meant so much to me . ” carla gorman has known aspa for years . sister ruth , too . teachers tend to cross paths , especially in smaller centres like peterborough . “ the picture of that little boy , it broke my heart , ” carla says . “ i was talking to aspa and i said : ‘you know what ? i really want to help somehow , i want to join a group . ’ and aspa said : ‘well , lise has one . ’ ” which was perfect for carla . lise teaches one grade 7 class at st . paul ’ s ; carla teaches the other . the group was now up to 13 . it also had a name : salaam peterborough—families helping families . sept . 25 , exactly two weeks after kristy ’ s post , was a huge day . sponsorship agreement holders were put on notice that ottawa was about to post 50 new syrian cases to the bvor stream . basic summaries of each case ( genders , ages , etc . ) would be shared , via email ; sahs could then claim a particular file , like a general manager on draft day . aspa wasn ’ t overly optimistic . syrian refugees were suddenly in high demand , and she knew each case would be scooped up . her hunch proved correct ; only 15 files were posted that friday , and none went to her diocese . the following monday , sept . 28 , another email arrived in her inbox . “ dear sponsors , ” it read . “ please find information on 10 more syrian bvor cases . ” the attached list included : bvor 417 : a mother and three children , ages 12 , 10 and 8 . bvor 418 : a husband , wife and three children , ages 7 , 6 and 3 . bvor 420 : another husband , wife and three children , ages 19 , 16 and 14 . aspa replied right away , saying she had a group willing to accept any of those three . she typed so frantically she misspelled her name at the end of the email ( asoa ) . “ i responded in 4 minutes ! ” she wrote lise at 12 : 16 p . m . “ let ’ s see what happens . ” another four minutes after that , aspa received the reply that eluded her on friday . “ hi aspa . bvor 417 is on hold for your sah . ” just 17 days after kristy turned to facebook in search of fellow sponsors , the group she created had been matched with its family : a single mom and three kids living in lebanon . while serving in afghanistan , lee - anne quinn treated children in remote villagesit was lunch hour at school when lise , sitting at her desk , received the confirmation email . she pumped her fist in the air— “ yes ! ” —and sprinted out of the classroom , her grade 7s trailing behind . “ i scooted as fast as i could to find carla and tell her the news , ” lise says . “ we hugged and jumped for joy , and then we went down the hall to find paulette . it was just a really exciting moment for us . ” one student asked if they ’ d won the lottery . “ something like that , ” mrs . fines replied . the confirmation email did not include the names ( or faith ) of the four family members , but it did provide some additional details about bvor 417 . the mother , a syrian , was described as a 41 - year - old homemaker with no education . her husband—wherever he was , dead or alive—appeared to be iraqi because all three kids were listed as iraqi citizens ( although the youngest daughter was born in syria , suggesting the family had moved back to the mother ’ s home country after living in iraq . ) under the category “ urgency ” was one word , in capital letters : high . when myra hirschberg read those details , she had two immediate thoughts . “ one was : ‘this woman doesn ’ t speak english , she has three kids , she is a single parent , and it ’ s going to be a major job for her to get on her feet when she gets here , ’ ” she says . “ thought two was : ‘she must be an amazingly strong person to have managed on her own to survive what she survived with three kids . ’ i don ’ t think i could have made it as far . ” ‘i think she ’ s pretty brave ’ by this point , the nation was immersed in two diversions : the tail end of the election campaign , and toronto blue jays playoff baseball . but with a family now secured , the group focused on its fundraising efforts . they needed $13 , 500 to match ottawa ’ s contribution , and the members ’ personal pledges put them about halfway there . a mix of social media and word - of - mouth would raise the rest—and then some . “ generosity begets generosity , ” says trevor , stephanie ’ s husband . “ it helps when people see we are just everyday canadians reaching out to help this family . ” friends and relatives handed over cash . a yoga instructor organized special classes , donating 100 per cent of the proceeds . a local painter auctioned off three pieces of art . kristy ’ s vet clinic set up $10 nail trims , with every penny going toward salaam peterborough ( the very first customer gave $100 instead ) . dentists offered their services free of charge . doctors , too . carla organized an auction at her house , where st . paul ’ s staff bid on each other ’ s services ( yard duty , for instance ) . she raised $1 , 400 . “ this has kind of renewed my faith in humanity , ” she says . “ people desperately , desperately want to help ; they just need the right outlet to contribute , ” says brad , phung ’ s husband . “ it ’ s been heartwarming to see the community rally behind us . ” and not only behind them . in addition to the 35 groups working with aspa , two dozen others are in the process of bringing syrian refugees to the peterborough region . by the end of 2016 , the city expects to be home to 350 , maybe more . “ i am not surprised at all , ” says serout omar , who owns a pizza parlour in town . “ peterborough is full of great people , i ’ m telling you . ” he would know . twenty years ago , a church group sponsored his family of iraqi kurds , who lived 10 years in a syrian refugee camp after fleeing saddam hussein ’ s chemical weapons . “ this is my home , ” says serout , 36 . “ i would never move . ” when he read about kristy ’ s group in a local newspaper , serout immediately reached out on facebook to offer help , including translating for the family once they arrive . his generosity allowed the members to check one more box on their very large to - do list . every sponsorship group must create a detailed settlement plan that meets the approval of their sah . where will the family live ? who will pick them up at the airport ? landline or cellphone ? salaam peterborough crafted an excel spreadsheet , with each line listing a different duty . apartment rental . school enrolment . social insurance numbers . neighbourhood tour . they were ready , or at least as ready as they could be . on nov . 12 , aspa received another update in her inbox : the woman and her kids had been interviewed by visa officers in beirut , and all ottawa needed was final confirmation that kristy ’ s group would be the sponsor . “ please go ahead and confirm , ” lise wrote back to aspa . “ yay ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i am so excited ! ” the group still didn ’ t know any names . they also had no idea that the anonymous family was huddled inside their beirut apartment at that very moment , steps from a busy market where two isis bombers went to die . ‘i ’ ve seen firsthand the desperation that these people live in ’ when shazim khan first noticed the sirens blinking in the distance , he assumed it was a car crash . as he steered closer , he saw the fire hoses pointed at his peterborough mosque . “ it was devastating , ” he recalls . “ someone threw some kind of accelerant through the window , but we don ’ t know who it was . ” the nov . 14 arson made international headlines : a canadian mosque—masjid al - salaam , literally the “ peace mosque ” —had been firebombed , an apparent hate crime triggered by islamic state ’ s rampage in paris the night before . smoke engulfed the main floor , plastering walls with soot and ash . some of the mosque ’ s 100 worshippers had been mingling inside only an hour earlier , celebrating the birth of a baby . “ this is the only mosque in peterborough , ” says khan , originally from guyana , who has served as imam for eight years . “ we thought it would be a huge setback for the community , but it actually turned out to be the opposite . ” a local man with no link to the mosque launched an online crowd - funding campaign to cover the repair bill , and within 30 hours , donations topped $110 , 000 . among the many who rushed to give were members of salaam peterborough . “ i think the person or people who attacked the mosque unwittingly gave a huge boost to the movement to welcome syrian refugees—because so many in the community became so eager to prove that those people were not representative of us , ” says myra , the dance instructor . “ i hope they are reading this and notice that . ” imam shazim khan says sponsoring refugees is god ’ s workstill , the apparent trigger behind the mosque arson—the terrorist attacks in paris , which killed 130—raised legitimate questions about the new government ’ s refugee plan , specifically the timing . reports out of france said one of the isis attackers might have been a syrian who snuck into europe amid the flood of migrants . was canada doing enough to conduct security checks on these potential newcomers ? and why the rush ? why do all 25 , 000 need to arrive by the end of 2015 ? liberal public safety minister ralph goodale assured canadians that every last syrian would be properly screened before arriving , but prime minister justin trudeau himself would later concede that the horror in paris played a role in his decision to slow down the original pledge . ( instead of bringing in 25 , 000 refugees by the end of 2015 , the new plan is to fly them all here by the end of february . ) ‘the mosque means a lot to this community ’ a career police officer , dave mcnab is anything but naive . he has witnessed his fair share of depravity , and he admits the bloodshed in paris sparked some soul - searching . “ i don ’ t think anybody in this group isn ’ t scared about the terrorist attacks , but ultimately you have to do what is right , ” he says . “ i don ’ t think you could look at a picture of a needy child and not know what the right thing is . ” ( says trevor : “ this is a mother and three children , and i really don ’ t think they ’ re any danger to our society . ” ) dave is standing at his kitchen counter , chopping lamb for tonight ’ s kebabs . kristy is beside him , prepping a pan of baklava . it is nov . 22 , another sunday , and the rest of the group members are on their way over for a meeting / celebration . aspa is coming , too , bringing along the final bits of paperwork . once signed , the sponsorship will become official . “ we ’ re doing a middle eastern theme , ” kristy says . “ i ’ m so excited . ” the members arrive at the front door , one by one . as the living room fills and the volume grows , the scene looks like any random cocktail party . a newcomer would have no idea that some of these people didn ’ t know each other two months ago . “ it ’ s been amazing , ” phung says . “ you couldn ’ t have asked for a better of group of people . ” lise and rick arrive with some homemade hummus . “ i feel like i ’ ve been thinking about her and the kids every day since sept . 28 , ” lise says , when asked about the family . “ i wonder : ‘are they hungry ? are they cold ? are they scared ? do they know we ’ re here ? do they know that we ’ re thinking about them and that we ’ re waiting for them ? ’ ” kristy invited another special guest tonight : shazim khan . it ’ s been a week since the mosque was firebombed , and the repair work has barely begun . ( mosque officials would later announce that their insurance policy covered the reconstruction , and that every penny raised by the crowd - funding campaign was donated to local charities . ) “ we are different , ” the imam tells the group , the living room hushed . he is wearing a white islamic robe and a black skull cap . “ we have different religious beliefs , we practise differently , but i think we share a lot of common values . we all care for one another , and this is what makes us human beings . ” “ our prophet said : ‘one who helps an orphan or a widow is like a person who stands in prayer and never finishes , ’ ” khan continues . “ i want to say how grateful we are that we have people in our community who are willing to share in this very noble task . ” group members sign the final paperwork with aspa bouzinelos ( left ) and sister ruth hennessey ( right ) when the time comes to sign the papers , aspa puts the documents on the coffee table . some group members hold up their smartphones and press record . kristy and lise do the honours , scribbling their signatures on multiple pages . neither can contain her smile . among the documents—finally—is the mystery woman ’ s name : amal alkhalaf , age 41 . the eldest daughter is ansam , who had just turned 13 . ibrahim is the boy , age 10 . the youngest , eight years old , is dalya . her ninth birthday is a few weeks away . long before the world knew the name alan kurdi , scores of syrian migrants followed the same watery path from turkey to greece , gambling their very lives for asylum in europe . thousands more have set out since . ( on jan . 4 , the mediterranean claimed another 36 victims , including three children . ) yet despite the dominant images—refugees wearing life jackets , crammed into rubber boats—the vast majority of displaced syrians are not trying to reach britain or germany or sweden . they are in purgatory , spread out among syria ’ s immediate neighbours . across the southern border in jordan , the united nations refugee agency ( unhcr ) has registered close to 800 , 000 . to the north , 2 . 2 million live in turkey . and to the west , lebanon has absorbed 1 . 1 million , if not more . the crisis may be most glaring in lebanon , an already fractured state that ’ s barely twice the size of prince edward island . before the war next door , the population was about four million ; it is now above five million—all while the lebanese government continues to spiral into disarray . sectarian squabbling has left the country without a president for nearly 600 days , and basic civic services have ground to a halt . drive anywhere , and it won ’ t be long before you ’ ll see a mound of garbage bags tossed on a roadside . tragically , the same is true about syrian refugees . they are literally everywhere here : sleeping on street corners , inside overcrowded motel rooms , and underneath plastic tarps that fill hundreds of rural , ramshackle camps . but unlike jordan , for example—where one camp , zaatari , is home to nearly 80 , 000 syrian refugees—there is no such central hub in lebanon . in fact , fewer than 20 per cent of the refugees here live in a camp . maclean ’ s travelled to lebanon in the hope , however slim , of finding amal alkhalaf and her children . other than their names ( and their canadian file number : bvor 417 ) , the peterborough group had no other leads to share . no city . no phone number . not even a photograph . the whole assignment had the feel of saving private ryan . for nearly a week , nothing panned out . sources working for various aid agencies queried their databases but came up empty . one said he actually found dozens of amal alkhalafs in his system , way too many to narrow down . if nothing else , the hail mary hunt reinforced just how lucky this woman is : maclean ’ s was scouring the country for a syrian refugee already selected to come to canada , while crossing paths with thousands more who will never receive such a gift . in the end , it was michelle cameron , canada ’ s ambassador to lebanon , who pulled the right strings . maclean ’ s reached out to the embassy , explaining the basics of this article and asking whether someone could contact amal on our behalf . on dec . 2 , the answer arrived . “ we found her , ” cameron said . she had a cell number . amal was willing to meet , but physically reaching her was hardly routine . maclean ’ s needed permission from hezbollah ’ s central press office just to pass through the military checkpoints that surround bourj el - barajneh , and the magazine was specifically instructed not to film or photograph outside . only three weeks had passed since the isis suicide attacks , and residents remained leery of unfamiliar faces . ( though a largely shia municipality , bourj el - barajneh is home to some sunnis , including a growing number of syrian refugees , because rent is relatively cheap . ) as planned , amal is waiting on the corner , dalya by her side . the little girl is wearing jeans and a sweater , green and red . mother and daughter don ’ t linger long , turning down an alleyway that leads back to their latest home : a decrepit , two - room apartment . the older kids , ansam and ibrahim , are inside the first - floor unit , though not alone . one of amal ’ s sisters - in - law also lives here—with her four children . at night , all nine squish together on the living - room carpet , sleeping in a windowless space that resembles a cave . the apartment ’ s other room is a small kitchen with cracked , crumbling walls . its only saving grace is the running water . after two islamic state suicide bombers struck her beirut neighbourhood on nov . 12 , amal and the children stopped going outside “ it was so scary , ” amal says , recalling the thunder of the twin explosions . “ but thank god my children weren ’ t in the street at that time . ” she has not let them outside since . a petite woman , barely five feet tall , amal sits down on the living room floor , her back leaning against the front door . dalya is still close by . ibrahim is beside them , wearing a thin brown jacket and bare feet . ansam ’ s hijab is navy blue . though only 13 , ansam is mature beyond her years , a second mom to the other two . “ i would love to study , ” she says , holding back tears . “ my only dream is to study . ” originally from the syrian city of raqqa , amal married an iraqi , and their first two children were born in her husband ’ s home country . during the second gulf war , however , the family crossed back to syria , where dalya was born in 2006 . they eventually settled in homs—a city that would soon be under siege . north of damascus , homs endured some of the heaviest fighting in the early months of the syrian uprising , as assad ’ s forces tried , but failed , to quell anti - government protests in the city . in august 2011 , amal ’ s husband left home , supposedly in search of food . he never came back . “ i don ’ t know anything about what happened to him , ” she says . “ i don ’ t know where he is . ” after a week , amal says she had no choice but to flee , taking the kids to the eastern city of al - bukamal , where some of her relatives lived . for a while , the kids were able to attend school , including some english classes , but it wasn ’ t long before isis took control of the city . yet again , the family was pinned into a combat zone . “ i don ’ t like the kids to talk about it , ” amal says . “ i am trying to get them to forget what happened there . ” she was not allowed to venture outside without a veil over her face and a male relative at her side . night after night , the children were jolted awake by the sound of fighter jets screaming overhead . “ my kids would wake up even if it was only raining , ” amal says . “ everything was terrible . isis was all around us . ” by september 2014 , the foursome was on the run again , inside a bus bound for the lebanese border . the kids haven ’ t seen a classroom for nearly two years . their mom has never been to school . not for one day . described as a “ homemaker ” in her canadian paperwork , amal earns zero income in lebanon , and her family survives largely on the kindness of others , including some siblings who live nearby . until recently , she and the kids lived with one of her sisters , but they were evicted after failing to pay the monthly rent ( 250 , 000 lebanese dollars , or about us$170 ) . “ i try my best every day to not let the children go to bed without food , ” amal says . “ but sometimes . . . ” the old cellphone she has was a gift from a friend , a hand - me - down . the screen was already shattered when she got it . her lifeline to the outside world ( especially the unhcr ) , amal pays us$10 a month to keep it on . although millions of syrians have registered with the un refugee agency , only a meagre fraction will be resettled in the west . when countries like canada do decide to offer up space , the unhcr recommends the most vulnerable , desperate cases : refugees with severe health problems . torture victims . poor , single mothers like amal alkhalaf . it was way back in december 2014—nine months before alan kurdi drowned , and when stephen harper was still prime minister—when she received the cellphone call that would change their lives . it was the embassy , informing her that canada was considering them for resettlement . “ i can ’ t describe how happy i was , ” she says . “ but at the same time i was sad because i didn ’ t know how long i would have to wait . one year ? two years ? god knows . ” eleven months , it turned out . the embassy called back in early november 2015 ( only a couple of weeks before the suicide bombings ) to invite her for an interview . “ the children talk about canada a lot , ” amal says . “ ‘are we going to have our own house ? is there no war ? are we going to have an established life ? ’ that is their dream . ” asked where she ’ d like to live , amal is quick to respond . “ i will stay at the canadian border , ” she says . “ the most important thing is that i reach canada . if they told me now to go the airport , i would grab my children and go to the airport . ” until today , amal has no idea that private citizens are working so hard on her behalf . she has never heard of the “ blended ” sponsorship program , and peterborough may as well be mars . when maclean ’ s explains where she ’ s going and how she ’ ll get there , amal seems overwhelmed , as if it can ’ t possibly be true . “ i want to thank them one and two and three and four and five times , as much as i can , ” she smiles , placing a hand over her heart . “ they are going to take me out of this swamp and i will see the world again , and they will offer education for my kids . ” if maclean ’ s found this woman , the peterborough group asked the reporter to pass along two things : an envelope containing some money , and a small token of their friendship and commitment—four miniature pins depicting the canadian flag , one for each of them . amal unwraps the tissue paper and picks up one of the red and white flags , turning it in her fingertips . “ this is like a trophy for me , ” she says , looking up . “ it is an honour to get the flag . i don ’ t know how i can express my thanks . i don ’ t know how i can express my feelings . ” the children lean in to see the gifts . “ i am going to put this in my heart , ” amal continues . “ i am proud . ” before saying goodbye , the woman asks maclean ’ s to deliver something of hers to the group : her cell number . “ i hope god gives me the time to meet them , ” she says . six days later , dec . 9 , the peterborough sponsors have a meeting scheduled , the perfect chance for a first phone call with amal . they ask serout , their new volunteer translator , to contact her in advance and ask if 7 p . m . works . of course , she says . it will be 2 a . m . in beirut , but she ’ s happy to huddle in her kitchen while everyone else is asleep . by now , salaam peterborough has another co - sponsor , its fourteenth . an environmental sciences professor at trent university , tom whillans dropped in at the new canadians centre the other day , hoping to find information about a group he could join . “ it ’ s an extremely important issue , ” he says . “ and it ’ s not just about donating money to a cause . the personal contact is really , really important . ” he ’ s known rick and lise casually for many years ( tom helps run a music festival rick plays in ) and when he noticed their names on a list , he knew where to go . tom knocked on their door . when they weren ’ t home , he came back another time . “ that is the peterborough we know , ” says lise , herself a trent graduate . “ that may sound sappy , but there are so many people like that in this community . ” ‘who is doing this for me ? ’ amal asked the group membersas 7 o ’ clock approaches , they gather in rick and lise ’ s kitchen . most of the group is here , huddled around the same island where lise and stephanie prepped all those slow - cooker recipes three months ago . rick is holding claire , the couple ’ s three - year - old . serout is sitting on a stool in the middle of the pack , his cell on speakerphone . “ allo , ” amal answers . for weeks , these men and women have thought of little else than this person on the other end of the phone . to suddenly hear her voice is almost a relief . kristy takes a deep breath , holding back tears . like lise and carla , myra can ’ t stop smiling . phung places a hand over her mouth . “ hello from canada , ” they say in unison , followed by “ marhaba , ” arabic for hello . “ marhaba , ” amal answers . everyone laughs . speaking through serout , amal thanks the strangers for their money and their kindness . but even with the language barrier , the group can sense her desperation . she doesn ’ t sound anywhere near as optimistic as she did just a few days ago , when maclean ’ s met her in lebanon . “ my situation is really bad , ” she says , beginning to cry . serout tries to reassure her . “ be patient , be strong , ” he says . “ everything is going to be ok . ” “ inshallah , ” she says . god willing . amal is especially worried about her family ’ s medical tests , the final step before boarding an airplane . it ’ s been more than a month since her interview with a canadian visa officer , yet she ’ s heard nothing about a doctor ’ s appointment . “ you don ’ t know how i live here , ” she tells the group . “ it ’ s like a grave . ” serout asks amal if she needs the sponsors to prepare anything specific for her arrival . “ nothing , nothing , ” she says . “ i only want to get out of here . i want my kids to see a new life and i want them to forget this sad life they have been in . just one hour here is too long . ” near the end of the call , amal asks a question : “ who is doing this for me ? ” a collection of families , serout replies , explaining how the sponsorship group will cover her family ’ s first year of expenses in canada . “ they don ’ t care if you are a muslim or not a muslim , ” he says . “ at last , we are humanity , ” amal answers . “ there is no black or white . ” as wonderful as it is to finally hear amal ’ s voice , the phone call is unexpectedly deflating . the group assumed all the hurdles had been cleared , including the medicals . listening to her break down only sharpens their resolve to get the family to canada . the next morning , dec . 10 , lise fires off an email to aspa ’ s main contact in immigration , asking about the medicals , but hears nothing back . later that evening , justin trudeau is at pearson international airport , welcoming the first planeload of syrian refugees to touch down . “ i was awake in the middle of the night , so i got up , ” lise says . “ carla had mentioned to me that there is some kind of website where you can check the status of your application , and sure enough , up pops this notice that says the government has been waiting for amal to take her medical since oct . 7 . ” she messages serout , who phones amal again . somehow , the oct . 7 notice never reached her . a few phone calls later , and the exams are booked . “ if we hadn ’ t been able to talk to her , we wouldn ’ t have had a clue that any of this was going on , ” lise says . “ she would still be sitting there . ” the news arrives on christmas afternoon , via serout . amal and the children have been told to be at beirut ’ s airport on dec . 28 , bright and early—three months to the day after being matched with the people from peterborough . “ get ready for your christmas gift , ” lise writes to the others on facebook . “ they are coming on the 29th ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ” when the 28th arrives , amal and the kids board a flight to jordan , their first ever ride on an airplane . ( “ i was really , really scared , ” she would later say . ) from there , the plan is to take a chartered jet directly to pearson , but it ’ s delayed . by the time they finally board , they ’ re 15 hours behind schedule—pushing back their arrival by one day , to dec . 30 . in peterborough , meanwhile , the sponsors have heard nothing official from ottawa . if amal wasn ’ t communicating with serout , the group would have no clue the flight was delayed . thanks to aspa , lise has a number for an airport employee who does know one thing : after landing , syrian refugees are being bused to a nearby hotel . the pickup crew , 90 minutes away , takes a calculated gamble : better to wait at that hotel than in peterborough , assuming amal will show up at some point . members of the sponsorship group meet the children for the first time at an airport hotelthey steer into the parking lot just before 5 : 30 p . m . on dec . 30 , split between two passenger vans : stephanie , lise , paulette , lee - anne , serout and tom ( the trent prof , not the retired engineer ) . a friend of dave ’ s , who owns a shuttle company , offered the vans ( and the two drivers ) as a donation . dave and kristy are not here tonight . they had booked a christmas trip long ago , and couldn ’ t cancel . although her emotions are mixed , kristy is thrilled beyond words that her facebook post has led to this moment . “ i love that we are such a team , ” she says . “ i think we ’ ll look back in 10 or 15 years , and this will be a very positive chapter in canada ’ s story , ” her husband adds . the group members mingle in the hotel lobby , watching as a busload of refugees , utterly exhausted , walk through the front entrance . “ welcome to canada , ” lee - anne says , hugging one woman . the retired major is holding a small canadian flag . her sister has a bouquet of flowers , red and white . as 6 p . m . approaches , another bus pulls up . serout sees them first . “ they ’ re here ! ” he yells . “ they ’ re here ! ” paulette repeats , rushing outside . “ oh my gosh , ” says stephanie , following lise and lee - anne to the door . amal flashes a wide smile as paulette wraps her arms around her shoulders , then reaches for the children , one by one . lee - anne is right behind her , amal ’ s next hug . she is wearing the same checkered hijab as she did that day in bourj el - barajneh—just 27 days ago . after two days of travel , the family finally arrives in peterborough , excited but exhausted “ are you dalya ? ” stephanie asks , smiling at the little girl . she turned nine on dec . 20 . in between hugs , lise tries not to cry . jingle bell rock is playing on the loudspeakers . tom and serout collect the family ’ s suitcases from under the bus as everyone heads to the lobby . ottawa has also provided care packages , giving each child a new winter jacket , boots , gloves and a toque . serout rips off the tag of dalya ’ s pink coat and helps her put it on . beside her , ibrahim waves lee - anne ’ s canadian flag . pinned to ansam ’ s jacket is the maple leaf the group sent to her in lebanon , via maclean ’ s . “ it is like a dream , ” amal says , now holding the bouquet of flowers . “ i am so happy just to be here safe . ” ‘i didn ’ t feel like a stranger at all . i felt at home . it ’ s like i knew these people a long time ago . ’ the three children climb into the back row of one of the vans while serout and amal take the two middle seats . a few minutes later , the caravan is merging onto highway 401 , heading east amid a sea of headlights . “ are we going to live here forever ? ” dalya asks . “ yes , ” serout answers . nineteen years ago , a young maryam monsef made a similar nighttime drive to peterborough . she didn ’ t speak english , and she had yet to meet sister ruth . today , monsef is a federal cabinet minister . “ that makes me feel like my kids have a good future , ” amal says , looking at the heavy traffic out her window . “ i can see it and i can feel it . the most important thing for me is that everybody is a human being and everybody gets respected and treated the same way . it doesn ’ t matter what religion or colour you are . ” it was heartbreaking , amal says , to leave her relatives—including the sister - in - law and kids who shared her apartment—but she hopes to one day help them get here , too . “ from what i ’ ve seen so far , canada is going to be even better than my imagination , ” she continues . “ i ’ m not asking for much . i just want my kids to be safe , to go to school , to have food . that is all i need . ” in the other van , lee - anne passes around some christmas chocolates . in between bites , she tells the others that what they just accomplished is as gratifying as anything she did in afghanistan . “ it is absolutely equivalent , without a doubt , ” she says . “ if we can sit here in this vehicle , in this country , and save somebody ’ s life , that is just as good as me being three oceans away saving somebody ’ s life . ” in the front seat , professor tom says amal ’ s family has just won the equivalent of a lottery . “ you also feel like it ’ s a lottery for us—that we were lucky enough to be born here , ” he says . “ we didn ’ t do anything to earn that . ” lee - anne tucks ibrahim into bed as dalya watches . in lebanon , the family slept on a floor . it is almost 9 : 30 p . m . when the vans steer into the driveway . the children are fast asleep , oblivious to the christmas lights hanging from some of the houses . amal is wearing a pair of ballet - style flats , no match for the snow she steps in as she exits the vehicle . phung , standing in the dark driveway , gives her a hug . when the kids emerge , drowsy and dazed , she squeezes them , too . she can ’ t help but wonder what her own mother was thinking all those decades ago . the group managed to secure a granny flat for the family , a temporary home until they find something more permanent . it could not be more inviting . the fridge is overflowing . a cake on the kitchen table says : “ welcome to canada . ” pieces of children ’ s artwork are hanging everywhere . “ we are so glad you are here , ” one says . “ you are loved , ” reads another . “ there is lots and lots of food , ” lise says . “ i don ’ t know how to thank you , ” says amal , still smiling . “ we are just very glad that you are here , ” lise replies . the children are so tired that they ’ re falling asleep sitting up , their jackets still zipped . phung leads ibrahim to the bedroom and puts him under the covers , while paulette and lee - anne show amal how to use the pull - out couch . the others start lacing up their shoes , knowing the family needs some space . “ i didn ’ t realize this was going to happen , ” amal says , thanking them one more time . “ this is more than enough . ” until their first morning in canada , the children had never touched snowthe next morning is new year ’ s eve . when serout stops by for a visit , arriving a few minutes after 9 o ’ clock , he doesn ’ t need to knock . everyone inside is wide awake . dalya was up at 6 a . m . , staring out the large bay window that overlooks the backyard . “ when i woke up , i felt i was in a dream , ” amal says . “ i told ibrahim to come to see the snow but he didn ’ t believe me . he thought i was making a joke . ” four weeks ago , this family woke up on the floor of that windowless living room in lebanon , too afraid to even venture outside . today , ibrahim is immersed in a lego set , almost finished piecing it together . a cartoon , super why , fills the flat - screen television that sits atop an electric fireplace . ansam is on the couch , reading about each of her new sponsors . ( the group prepared information sheets with photos and brief biographies , in english and arabic . ) dalya is still perched on the windowsill , gazing out . the group left behind two new ipads on the kitchen counter , with an itunes gift card to match . amal says there ’ s another gift card , too , pointing to the name on serout ’ s coffee cup ( tim hortons ) . she will learn . “ i cannot describe the life here compared to where i was , ” she says . “ it ’ s like from hell to heaven . ” not every day will be so euphoric . adjusting to the pace and culture of a new country is an overwhelming journey , even for the most grateful refugee , and as the weeks go by , amal and her children will no doubt endure some darker emotions than they feel right now . serout remembers his own family ’ s experience ; at one point , they considered returning to their tent in syria because they found it so hard to acclimatize to canada . “ we were going crazy , to be honest , ” he says . ‘canada is going to be even better than my imagination . i want my kids to be safe , to go to school ’ real life lies ahead . dentist appointments . health care applications . first day of school . amal has never learned to read or write , and as excited as she is to tackle english ( “ to learn canadian , ” as she says ) , the road will be long and challenging . even this gorgeous granny flat—full of bright sunlight and fresh paint and a shiny bathroom—is temporary . with the group ’ s help , amal must start looking for a place she can afford once the sponsorship support runs dry next year . a job ? that ’ s listed on the resettlement plan , too . near the door , the kids start zipping up their jackets and sliding on their boots . amal tugs on dalya ’ s knit hat , ensuring it covers her ears . “ go play as much as you want because we are going to be here one week and then they are going to send us back , ” amal jokes . “ they ’ re not going to send us back ! ” her daughter replies . a wooden deck leads to a large backyard , where a motorboat is covered with a plastic tarp . ansam ’ s boots crunch through a thin layer of icy snow , a sound as canadian as any . “ only in pictures , ” she says , when asked if she has ever seen snow before . standing on the deck , amal watches as a snowball fight ensues . she is still digesting the events of last night , strangers running to hug her . “ i didn ’ t feel like a stranger at all , ” she says . “ i basically felt at home . it ’ s like i knew these people a long time ago . ” paulette the french teacher pulls into the driveway . “ hello , hello , ” she says . “ you look so nice in your new coats ! ” all three kids get another hug . carrying a jug of road salt , paulette immediately starts sprinkling the deck . “ i noticed it was slippery last night , ” she says . amal watches , not quite sure what to think . paulette ’ s first job today is to take the family to the mall so they can buy a new cellphone . amal ’ s old one—the hand - me - down with the shattered screen—is long gone . “ i threw it in the garbage at the airport , ” she smiles . reporter : michael friscolantieditor : dianna symonds and alison unclesdirector of photography : liz sullivanart director : stephen gregorydigital production editor : amanda shendrukvideo producer : kayla chobotiuk , michael friscolanti , and liz sullivanphotographers : cole garside and sam tarlingvideographers : afp , getty , cole garside and sam tarlingvideo editor : kayla chobotiukpublished : january 13 , 2016
__label__relevant wiff documentary shines spotlight on female genital mutilation ask giselle portenier why she chose to travel to tanzania for her latest documentary , and she ' ll say that tanzania actually chose her . according to the self - described human rights filmmaker , whose latest project in the name of your daughter is set to screen at this year ' s windsor international film festival ( wiff ) , it was actually a google alert about female genital mutilation ( fgm ) that led portenier to her next project . " i was looking for a story that might be accessible to my audience , that people could engage with , " said portenier . " i had [set] a google alert about female genital mutilation for about five years , and one day , this story popped up about a safehouse that saves girls from their own parents so that they won ' t be mutilated . " as a documentarian , portenier has spent much of her career making films about the human rights of women and children around the world . " i ' ve made films about honour killings in pakistan and child slavery in africa , " she said . " female genital mutilation is something that had always eluded me , but i always felt was a very important topic . " listen to gisele portenier discuss her film on windsor morning : female genital mutilation is the subject of a documentary screening at the windsor international film festival . if you think it ' s something that only affects women in far - flung countries , you ' re be mistaken . tony speaks with director giselle portenier about why this film , and this difficult subject , is something all canadians should pay attention to . 8 : 54when portenier came across the safehouse in tanzania — run by rhobi samwelly , who is heavily featured in portenier ' s latest film — she knew she had a responsibility to tell the story of the women and girls who rely on the organization for security . " my film is really about the voices of the girls , the voices of the children who are running away to save themsleves from female genital mutilation and the child marriage that follows thereafter , " portenier said . still , while the film touches on a topic that has affected hundreds of millions of girls around the world — including almost 100 , 000 girls and women in canada — portenier said she hopes audiences leave the documentary inspired . wiff executive director vincent georgie says the festival doesn ' t shy away from films that portray complicated subject matter . ( katerina georgieva / cbc ) " [i hope] audiences walk away from it inspired by the children , because some of them are only eight - years - old , " she said . " imagine an eight - year - old risking her life and her family by running away from home , just so she won ' t have to go through the mutilation that she ' s heard about perhaps at school and knows is a risk to her life and her future . " vincent georgie , executive director and chief programmer of wiff , said the festival doesn ' t shy away from films that cover sensitive topics , adding that in the name of your daughter is a " very important film to show at the festival , and one that we believe in very much . " " one of the luxuries of running a large film festival like ours , is you ' re able to bring in all sorts of different films for different audiences and different points of view , " he said . " and we ' ve never shied away from films that are challenging our films that are different or films that provoke or make you think . " ' i hope it ' s educational , ' says survivorfrancis cole , a survivor of female genital mutilation , who advocates for women and girls around the world by sharing her own story , said she ' s portenier ' s film educates audiences , rather than presenting an inaccurate view of the issue . " i hope that this has a message of educating people about the practice , " she said . " i just hope that they ' ll be made more aware if they ' re not already aware about what fgm is . " cole said she also hopes portneir ' s film acknowledges that fgm isn ' t just a practice maintained by any one particular religious group . francis cole is a female genital mutilation survivor who advocates against the practice . ( amy dodge / cbc ) " when people hear about fgm , they automatically think it ' s a muslim thing , " said cole , who has yet to see in the name of your daughter . " i was raised catholic and i wasn ' t spared . " cole added that she hopes audiences understand that fgm is a " global issue . " " it ' s a human rights violation , " she said . " it ' s torture and it has lifelong consequence and it ' s happening all around us . it ' s no longer happening in some remote village in a country in africa . " speaking about the subject , portenier acknowledged that an important thing to note is that fgm " doesn ' t have anything to do with religion . " " [in] the safehouse , for instance , there are children from muslim communities , children from christian communties and also from animist traditions , " she said . fgm is about ' sexual control of girls , ' says filmmakerwhile many might believe female genital mutilation is a cultural practice , portenier said the truth is far less complicated . " the common denominator everywhere is sexual control of girls , " she said . " it ' s thought that if you put a girl through female genital mutilation , she won ' t be having sex before marriage , and then she won ' t be having affairs — be unfaithful — during marriage . " at the same time , portenier wants her audience to understand that topics like female genital mutilation don ' t just take place in so - called " other " parts of the world . " there are 200 million survivors and every 11 seconds somewhere in the world , a girl is going through fgm and that ' s a lot of children , " she said . " it ' s also a canadian issue … because we have upwards of 100 , 000 survivors in canada and these women are not getting the support that they need . " " and we have girls at risk . government documents show that girls are being taken in the summer months back to their home country to be cut . " windsor refugee settlement agency connects fgm survivors with access to caremike morency , executive director of windsor ' s matthew house refugee welcome centre , echoed portenier ' s comments about fgm survivors in canada . according to morency , his agency has seen an increase in women fleeing to canada to escape fgm or who have already experienced the issue . " we ' re certainly seen an increase in the number of people fleeing to canada , and while that ' s not the exclusive reason for their refugee claim , it is part of their story , " he said . matthew house executive director mike morency says access to trauma counselling is essential for survivors of female genital mutilation . ( chris ensing / cbc ) as for how matthew house provides support to survivors , morency said an important part of the work he does is " connecting them with counsellors , trauma experts to deal with the experiences that they have had prior to coming to canada . " " depending on the depth of their trauma , we would want to try to make sure that they get connected with a counselor that has trauma treatment experience and help them walk through that process , " morency said .
